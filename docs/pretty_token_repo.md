1. Reorder Layout

Left panel = Global chat

Give it 20–25% width.

Persistent, scrollable, compact message bubbles.

Title: “Global Chat”.

Keep it visually distinct with a slightly darker background than the token list.

Middle panel = Tokens (anchor)

Give it 30–35% width.

Expand the current list into something closer to a dashboard:

Token name + avatar

Price + % change (color-coded up/down)

Mini-sparkline (last 24h trend)

Market cap, liquidity

Sort/filter options (by market cap, by watch status).

Search bar at top.

Highlight the selected token so the right thread is clearly tied to it.

Right panel = Token thread

Give it 40–45% width.

Sticky header: token avatar, name, current price, 24h chart, Unwatch button.

Below: per-token chat.

Different background shade from global chat → separates contexts.

Add tag chips (visual pills instead of plain text input).

2. Visual Hierarchy & Background Layers

Left panel (Global Chat) → darkest background (#0E0E12 style).

Middle panel (Tokens) → slightly lighter background to pop as “anchor.”

Right panel (Token Thread) → same as middle or even lighter, but with carded chat bubbles to keep clarity.

Rounded corners, consistent spacing (8–12px).

Subtle shadows on panels to avoid “wooden wall.”

3. Message Design

Group consecutive messages by same author (no repeated name/timestamp unless break).

Alternate bubble alignment (sender vs other).

Hover bar with icons: reply, pin, copy, react. No more hidden under three dots.

Divider for “New messages” and scroll-to-latest button.

4. Token Functionality Enhancements

Unread indicators (badge count) per token.

Pin favorite tokens to top.

Hover on token → quick info card (price, % change, recent activity).

Search/autocomplete for tags.

5. Usability Polishing

Global chat auto-scroll but pauses if user scrolls up.

Token thread: when a message is referenced in global chat, clicking it jumps/highlights in token thread.

Input bar unified style: placeholder changes depending on panel (“Share insight globally…” vs “Discuss $TOKEN…”).

Keyboard shortcuts:

Ctrl+Enter to send

/token to quickly jump to a token thread

6. Suggested Width Ratio (desktop)

Global Chat: 20–25%

Tokens: 30–35%

Token Thread: 40–45%

This order of changes →

Apply background separation for context clarity.

Upgrade token list to dashboard-like (sparklines, % changes, sorting).

Refine chat UX (grouping, replies, reactions, scroll-to-latest).

Enhance per-token header (sticky, live stats, tags as chips).

Add polish (unread badges, hover states, shortcuts).
