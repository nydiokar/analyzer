# Wallet Analysis System Refactoring Implementation Plan (Revised)

**Status Update (as of current conversation):** Core logic extraction is largely complete. Scripts are refactored. Key API endpoints are up. Dashboard integration is progressing. **A significant recent update involved refining how the system tracks the analyzed period for wallets: introduced `analyzedTimestampStart` and `analyzedTimestampEnd` to the `Wallet` model, replacing previous, more ambiguous fields. This fixed a critical bug where P/L analysis (especially with `--fetchOlder`) was incorrectly skipped. The `helius-analyzer.ts` script and `PnlAnalysisService` now use this improved state management. `HeliusSyncService` correctly sets overall fetched boundaries.** User/ActivityLog, balance fetching, and initial dashboard tabs are also in place. **The Analysis Triggering API Endpoint & Frontend Integration (formerly Immediate Focus item #1) is now COMPLETE.** **The Basic Sidebar Wallet Navigation task (Task #2) has seen significant progress, detailed below.** For detailed status on dashboard components and UI refinements, please see Phase 5.

## Recently Completed (Backend & Initial Dashboard Setup)

*   Core backend refactoring, API development, and initial dashboard setup are largely complete. Specific dashboard component completions and UI refinements are detailed within **Phase 5: Dashboard Integration**.
*   **Analysis Triggering API Endpoint & Frontend Integration:** Task completed. This involved creating the `POST /api/v1/analyses/wallets/:walletAddress/trigger-analysis` backend endpoint. On the frontend, `WalletProfileLayout.tsx` now includes a trigger button with loading/toast feedback, SWR cache revalidation, and display of the last analysis time/status. Backend `WalletsController.getWalletSummary` was also refined to reliably provide `lastAnalyzedAt`.


# ======== Immediate focus ==========

This section outlines the critical tasks for the upcoming development cycle(s), prioritized to enhance core functionality and user experience.

### High Priority (Next Working Session Focus)

1.  **Implement Skeleton Loaders for Dashboard UI (Targeted Polish):**
    *   **Goal:** Enhance user experience by implementing skeleton loaders in key dashboard areas, making the UI feel more responsive during data loading. **This is the primary development task for the next session.**
    *   **Status:** `COMPLETE`
    *   **Key Areas of Focus (based on user input & feasibility):**
        *   `AccountSummaryCard.tsx` headers/metric placeholders.
        *   `TokenPerformanceTab.tsx` table rows (e.g., 3-5 skeleton rows).
        *   `AccountStatsPnlTab.tsx` content within "Period Specific" and "All-Time" cards.
        *   `BehavioralPatternsTab.tsx` placeholders for metric grids or small charts.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Utilize `shadcn/ui` `<Skeleton />` components.
        *   Ensure skeletons accurately reflect the structure of the content they are replacing.
        *   Integrate with existing SWR `isLoading` states, potentially showing skeletons before `EmptyState` if data fetch takes time but isn't an error/empty final state.
    *   **Reference:** Detailed plan and acceptance criteria in `docs/999.Features.md`.

2.  **Deploy Dashboard & Backend (Initial Self-Hosted Version):**
    *   **Goal:** Make the current version of the dashboard and its backend API publicly accessible for testing and initial use. **This is the secondary, but equally important, focus for the next session(s) immediately following skeleton loader implementation.**
    *   **Status:** `To Do`

    *   **A. Backend Deployment (Self-Hosted on Raspberry Pi 5):**
        *   **1. Preparation & Code Deployment:**
            *   Ensure your NestJS backend project has a production build script (e.g., `npm run build` which typically outputs to a `dist` folder).
            *   Transfer the entire backend project (or at least the `dist` folder, `node_modules`, `package.json`, `.env` file) to your Raspberry Pi 5. (Using `git clone` and then `npm install --production` followed by `npm run build` on the RPi5 is often cleaner than transferring `node_modules`).
        *   **2. Environment Configuration (`.env` file on RPi5):**
            *   `DATABASE_URL`: Ensure this points to your SQLite file path (or PostgreSQL connection string if you migrate later) *as accessible from the RPi5 filesystem*.
            *   `PORT`: The port your NestJS application will listen on internally (e.g., `3001`).
            *   Any other API keys or secrets your backend application itself needs.
            *   `NODE_ENV=production`
        *   **3. PM2 Setup (Process Management):**
            *   Install PM2 globally if not already: `sudo npm install pm2 -g`.
            *   Create a PM2 Ecosystem File (e.g., `ecosystem.config.js`) in your backend project root on the RPi5. This provides a structured way to manage your app.
                *   **Example `ecosystem.config.js`:**
                    ```javascript
                    module.exports = {
                      apps : [{
                        name        : "my-analyzer-backend", // Choose a name
                        script      : "dist/main.js",     // Path to your NestJS entry point
                        watch       : false,              // Or true, or specify paths to watch
                        max_memory_restart : '1G',       // Optional: restart if it exceeds memory
                        env_production: {                // Environment variables for production
                           NODE_ENV: "production",
                           PORT: 3001, // Ensure this matches your app and .env
                           // DATABASE_URL can also be set here or preferably in .env loaded by your app
                        }
                      }]
                    };
                    ```
            *   Start your application using PM2: `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production` (or just `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js` if `NODE_ENV` is in the file).
            *   Verify it's running: `pm2 list` or `pm2 logs my-analyzer-backend`.
            *   Save PM2 process list to resurrect on reboot: `pm2 save`.
            *   Enable PM2 startup script: `pm2 startup` (it will give you a command to run).
        *   **4. Public Accessibility (Router & DNS):**
            *   **Port Forwarding:** Configure your home router to forward an external port (e.g., `8080` or `3001` if your ISP doesn't block it; `443` if you set up HTTPS later) to your Raspberry Pi's internal IP address and the `PORT` your NestJS app is listening on (e.g., internal port `3001`).
            *   **Dynamic DNS (DDNS):** Set up a DDNS service (e.g., No-IP, DuckDNS) to get a stable hostname (e.g., `your-backend.duckdns.org`) that points to your home router's public IP address. Your router might have built-in DDNS client support, or you can run a DDNS client on the RPi5.
            *   **Firewall (on RPi5):** Ensure `ufw` (or other firewall) allows incoming connections on the port your NestJS app uses (e.g., `sudo ufw allow 3001/tcp`).
        *   **5. Nginx Reverse Proxy (Recommended for Robustness & HTTPS - Future Enhancement if not done initially):**
            *   Install Nginx: `sudo apt install nginx`.
            *   Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to listen on port 80 (HTTP) and/or 443 (HTTPS) and forward traffic to your NestJS app (e.g., `http://localhost:3001`).
            *   Obtain and configure SSL certificates (e.g., using Let's Encrypt with Certbot) for HTTPS. This is crucial for security.
            *   **Benefit:** Handles SSL, can serve static files, provides an extra security layer, can do basic load balancing if you ever run multiple instances.

    *   **B. Frontend Deployment (Vercel):**
        *   **1. Project Setup & Git:**
            *   Ensure your Next.js dashboard code (`dashboard` directory) is a Git repository and pushed to a provider like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
        *   **2. Connecting to Vercel:**
            *   Sign up/log in to Vercel.
            *   Import your Git repository.
            *   Vercel typically auto-detects Next.js projects and configures build settings correctly. Review these if needed (e.g., root directory if your dashboard is in a subdirectory of the repo).
        *   **3. Environment Variables on Vercel:**
            *   In your Vercel project settings, navigate to "Environment Variables."
            *   Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY`: The API key your frontend will use to authenticate with your backend. **This key is user-facing (public) in the sense that it's embedded in the frontend code, so it should be an API key that your backend uses to identify the *frontend application itself* or a *specific user*, not a master backend secret.**
            *   Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`: The full public URL of your self-hosted RPi5 backend. This will be your DDNS hostname and the public port you forwarded (e.g., `http://your-backend.duckdns.org:8080/api/v1` or `https://your-backend.duckdns.org/api/v1` if you set up Nginx with HTTPS).
            *   **Modularity/Avoiding Lock-in:** Vercel environment variables are standard. The key is that your *application code* reads these standard environment variables (e.g., `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`). If you move to another hosting provider, you'd just set up the same environment variables there. Your code doesn't need to change. Avoid using Vercel-specific APIs or features *for core functionality* if portability is a major concern.
        *   **4. Build & Deployment Settings (Review Defaults):**
            *   **Build Command:** Usually `npm run build` or `next build`.
            *   **Output Directory:** Usually `.next`.
            *   **Install Command:** Usually `npm install`.
            *   Vercel handles these well for Next.js.
        *   **5. Trigger Deployment:** Typically happens automatically on push to your main branch, or you can trigger manually.

    *   **C. Post-Deployment Steps & Best Practices:**
        *   **1. Thorough Testing:** Access your dashboard via its Vercel URL. Test all functionalities, especially those involving API calls to your RPi5 backend (API key input, `trigger-analysis`, data fetching for all tabs).
            *   Pay attention to API call success/failure, loading times (especially `trigger-analysis` given RPi5 limitations).
        *   **2. Enhanced Landing Page & API Key Handling (User Experience & Access Control):**
            *   **Goal:** Provide a clear path for users to use their own API key for full access, while also offering a demo mode with pre-selected wallets for exploration without requiring a key for those specific demos.
            *   **Landing Page (`dashboard/src/app/page.tsx`):**
                *   Implement a prominent API key input field: "Enter API Key for Full Access".
                *   On submission, store the key in `localStorage`.
                *   Add a section: "Explore Demo Wallets" listing 2-3 predefined public demo wallet addresses. These links navigate to `/wallets/[demoWalletAddress]`.
            *   **Frontend API Logic (`fetcher.ts` & component calls):**
                *   When making API calls, `fetcher.ts` should retrieve the API key from `localStorage`. If present, include it in the `X-API-Key` header.
                *   If no key is in `localStorage` (e.g., user hasn't entered one), no `X-API-Key` header is sent for requests originating from navigating to a demo wallet profile or if the backend is set up to serve demo data without a key.
                *   For actions like using the main wallet search bar for a *non-demo* wallet or triggering analysis, if no API key is in `localStorage`, the UI should prompt the user to enter a key first or display an error message if a backend call fails due to a missing key.
            *   **Backend API Logic (NestJS - for Demo vs. Full Access Control - Option A from discussion):**
                *   Define a list of public demo wallet addresses (e.g., in `.env` or config).
                *   In an API authentication guard/middleware:
                    *   If a request has a valid `X-API-Key` header: Allow access for any wallet.
                    *   If no `X-API-Key` (or an invalid one) is present:
                        *   Check if the requested `walletAddress` (from route params) is in the predefined list of demo wallets.
                        *   If YES (it's a demo wallet): Allow the (read-only) request to proceed.
                        *   If NO (not a demo wallet): Return 401/403 error (e.g., "API Key required to analyze this wallet").
                *   The `trigger-analysis` endpoint (`POST /api/v1/analyses/wallets/:walletAddress/trigger-analysis`) MUST ALWAYS require a valid, non-demo API key. No new analyses for demo-mode users.
        *   **3. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) on Backend:**
            *   Your NestJS backend on the RPi5 **must** be configured to allow requests from your Vercel frontend's domain. If not, browser security will block the API calls.
            *   In your NestJS `main.ts`, enable CORS: `app.enableCors({ origin: 'https://your-vercel-dashboard-url.vercel.app' });` (or use `*` for initial testing, but be more specific for production).
        *   **4. Logging & Monitoring (Basic):**
            *   **Backend (PM2):** Regularly check `pm2 logs my-analyzer-backend` on the RPi5 for errors or performance issues.
            *   **Frontend (Vercel):** Vercel provides deployment logs and some runtime logs/analytics.
        *   **5. Documentation (Internal):**
            *   Create a `DEPLOYMENT.md` file or a section in your main `README.md`.
            *   Document: DDNS setup, port forwarding rules, PM2 configuration, Vercel project settings (especially env var names), and the deployment process for both frontend and backend. This will be invaluable for your future self or collaborators.
        *   **6. Incremental Updates:** Once set up, deploying updates to the frontend on Vercel is usually as simple as pushing to your Git main branch. For the backend, you'd pull changes on the RPi5, rebuild, and restart the PM2 process (`pm2 restart my-analyzer-backend`).
        *   **7. Backup (RPi5):** Regularly back up your RPi5's SD card or at least your application code, database file, and critical configurations (`.env`, Nginx configs, PM2 ecosystem file).

    *   **D. Considerations for Self-Hosting Backend (RPi5):**
        *   **Reliability:** Home internet connections and hardware can be less reliable than cloud providers. Be prepared for occasional downtime.
        *   **Security:** You are responsible for securing the RPi5 (OS updates, firewall, secure SSH, etc.).
        *   **Performance:** The RPi5 has limitations. The transaction insertion performance is a known point. Monitor resource usage (CPU, RAM) during heavy analysis.
        *   **ISP Terms of Service:** Some ISPs frown upon hosting public servers on residential connections. Usually not an issue for low-traffic personal projects.

### Medium Priority (Follow-on Tasks After Initial Deployment)

1.  **Pilot "Wallet Comparison" / "Find Similar Wallets" Feature:**
    *   **Goal:** Introduce initial functionality for comparing the current wallet to others or finding wallets with similar behavioral/performance characteristics.
    *   **Status:** `To Do`
    *   **Backend Tasks:**
        *   Verify `SimilarityService` (Phase 2.1.3) is suitable for providing basic similarity scores or vectors.
        *   Design and implement a new API endpoint, e.g., `GET /api/v1/wallets/{walletAddress}/similar?limit=5`. This endpoint should leverage `SimilarityService` to find and return a list of wallet addresses and perhaps a key similarity metric/reason.
    *   **Frontend Tasks:**
        *   Design a simple UI element (e.g., a button "Find Similar" on `WalletProfileLayout.tsx` or within a specific tab like "Overview" or "Behavioral Patterns").
        *   Upon user interaction, call the new API endpoint.
        *   Display the returned list of similar wallet addresses (e.g., in a modal or a small, dismissible section). For each similar wallet, display its address and allow navigation to its profile.
    *   **Note:** Keep this a pilot; focus on a simple, demonstrable version. The complexity will be in the `SimilarityService`'s logic, not necessarily the UI.

2.  **AI Insights for Overview Tab (Conceptual Planning & Prototyping):**
    *   **Goal:** Define and prototype how the "Overview" tab could be enriched with AI-generated summaries and insights, leveraging existing data from wallet analysis.
    *   **Status:** `To Do`
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   **Brainstorming (Conceptual):**
            *   What kind of narrative insights would be most valuable for a user looking at a wallet's overview? (e.g., "This wallet shows a pattern of early accumulation of X-type tokens," "Profitability is high but driven by a few large wins," "Recent activity suggests a shift from Y strategy to Z strategy.")
            *   Which data points from `/summary`, `/pnl-overview`, and `/behavior-analysis` API endpoints are key inputs for these insights?
        *   **UI Sketching:**
            *   How and where would these AI-generated text summaries be displayed on the "Overview" tab (or a dedicated section within it)? (e.g., a new "AI Analysis" card).
        *   **Prototyping (Optional Stretch Goal for the session):**
            *   Select one or two simple insights.
            *   Manually craft a prompt structure that takes key data points for a *single* wallet.
            *   Use a readily available LLM (e.g., via a playground or a simple script if you have API access) to generate a textual summary based on these data points and the prompt. This is to test the feasibility of generating coherent text, not to build a full UI integration yet.
    *   **Note:** This task is primarily about planning and exploring feasibility. The main deliverable is a clearer concept and potentially some example AI-generated texts. Reference Phase 6 for broader AI integration context.

3.  **Backend Performance Optimization (Transaction Insertion):**
    *   **Goal:** Improve the performance and reliability of the `trigger-analysis` process, especially for large wallets on resource-constrained hardware like the Raspberry Pi 5.
    *   **Status:** `To Do`
    *   **Key Actions:**
        *   Investigate and implement optimized transaction insertion: pre-filter duplicates and use `createMany` in batches if possible.
        *   Ensure individual `create` operations (if still used for some cases) are wrapped within a single database transaction to improve throughput.
        *   Benchmark improvements.


### Lower Priority (Defer for Now)

*   **Full Sidebar Enhancements:** Advanced features like user-savable wallet lists, fully functional "Settings" and "Documentation" pages (beyond basic navigation and search).

- `HeliusApiClient`: Assumed functional based on plan. - **VERIFIED**
- `HeliusTransactionMapper`: Assumed functional based on plan. - **VERIFIED**

## Phase 3: Script Refactoring (Ongoing -> Largely Complete)

**Goal:** Transform scripts in `src/scripts/` to act as simple orchestrators or entry points that primarily call the new services.

### 3.1 `activityCorrelator.ts`
- **Status: Complete**
- The script now handles CLI argument parsing (wallet source, excludeMints, timeRange).
- It instantiates `DatabaseService`, `CorrelationService`, and `ReportingService`.
- It creates `CorrelationAnalysisConfig` with CLI args.
- It calls `reportingService.generateAndSaveCorrelationReport` to orchestrate the analysis and reporting.
- Internal logic for fetching, filtering, PNL calculation, analysis, clustering, and report generation has been removed.

### 3.2 `wallet-behavior-analyzer.ts`
- **Status: Complete** 
- The script now handles CLI argument parsing (walletAddress, label, excludeMints, timeRange).
- It instantiates `DatabaseService`, `BehaviorService`, and `ReportingService`.
- It creates `BehaviorAnalysisConfig` with CLI args.
- It calls `behaviorService.analyzeWalletBehavior`.
- It calls `reportingService.generateAndSaveIndividualBehaviorReport`.
- Internal logic for fetching, analysis, and reporting has been removed.

### 3.3 `kpi-comparison-report.ts`
- **Status: Complete** 
- The script now handles CLI argument parsing (walletList file, excludeMints, timeRange).
- It instantiates `DatabaseService`, `BehaviorService`, `KPIComparisonAnalyzer`, and `ReportingService`.
- It creates `BehaviorAnalysisConfig` with CLI args.
- It calls `reportingService.generateComparativeBehaviorReport`.
- Internal logic for fetching, analysis, and reporting has been removed.

### 3.4 `walletSimilarity.ts`
- **Status: To Do**
- **Goal:** Update `main` function to orchestrate service calls.
- **Required Refactoring Steps:**
    - Parse CLI args (wallet source, vector type, potentially timeRange/excludeMints).
    - Instantiate `DatabaseService` and `SimilarityService`.
    - Create `SimilarityAnalysisConfig` (potentially including timeRange/excludeMints).
    - Instantiate `ReportingService` (injecting `SimilarityService`).
    - Call `reportingService.generateAndSaveSimilarityReport(walletAddresses, vectorType)`.
    - Remove internal logic for fetching, shared token analysis, vector creation, similarity calc, and reporting.

### 3.5 `helius-analyzer.ts`
- **Status: Complete**
- **Description:** The script has been refactored to act as an orchestrator, leveraging dedicated services (`HeliusSyncService`, `PnlAnalysisService`, `ReportingService`, `DatabaseService`) for data synchronization, analysis, and reporting. **Crucially, its logic for determining whether to re-run P/L analysis has been updated to use the new `analyzedTimestampStart`/`analyzedTimestampEnd` fields in conjunction with overall fetched timestamps from `HeliusSyncService`, fixing previous issues with `--fetchOlder` and ensuring more robust re-analysis triggers.**
- **Key Components Used:**
    - `HeliusSyncService`: Manages data fetching, mapping, and storage. Its role in setting `firstProcessedTimestamp` and `newestProcessedTimestamp` on the `Wallet` model has been verified as correct for the new analysis trigger logic.
    - `PnlAnalysisService`: Orchestrates P/L and stats calculation. **It now correctly updates `analyzedTimestampStart` and `analyzedTimestampEnd` on the `Wallet` model after a successful analysis.**
    - `ReportingService`: Generates and saves Markdown/CSV reports.
    - `DatabaseService`: Used directly by the script for managing `AnalysisRun` records.
    - `cliUtils` / `displayUtils`: For parsing and displaying.
- **Refactoring Steps Taken (Summary):**
    1. Extracted core swap logic to `SwapAnalyzer`.
    2. Extracted core stats logic to `AdvancedStatsAnalyzer`.
    3. Created `HeliusSyncService` for data fetching/syncing (verified its wallet state updates).
    4. Created `PnlAnalysisService` for orchestrating analysis (updated its wallet state updates).
    5. Updated `ReportingService` and `report_utils.ts` for PNL reports.
    6. Refactored `helius-analyzer.ts` script to use these services and manage `AnalysisRun` persistence, **including the refined analysis trigger logic.**

## Phase 4: API Layer Implementation (COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Develop a robust API layer to expose analysis functionalities for client applications (e.g., dashboards), enable user tracking, and support scalable architecture. This phase transitions the system from script-driven to service-accessible.

### 4.1 API Design Principles & Technology

#### 4.1.1 Foundational Principles
- **RESTful Architecture:** Adhere to REST principles for resource naming, HTTP methods, and status codes.
- **Statelessness:** API endpoints will be stateless where possible, not relying on server-side session memory between requests.
- **Versioning:** API endpoints will be versioned (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) to allow for future iterations without breaking existing clients.
- **Consistent Error Handling:** Implement a standardized error response format.
- **Authentication:** Secure endpoints using API key-based authentication.

#### 4.1.2 API Technology Stack & Framework Selection
- **Context:** The backend is TypeScript-based, utilizing Prisma. The API layer should integrate seamlessly.
- **Recommendation:** A Node.js framework is highly recommended.
    - **NestJS:** An opinionated, TypeScript-first framework promoting robust architectural patterns (modules, services, controllers) that align well with the existing service-oriented structure. Provides strong out-of-the-box support for OpenAPI (Swagger) generation, validation, and more.

#### 4.1.3 API Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- **Requirement:** Implement automated generation of OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation from the outset. 
- **Benefits:** Provides a live, accurate API reference crucial for dashboard developers, simplifies development, testing, and future maintenance.
- **Implementation:** 
    - If NestJS is chosen, it has excellent built-in support.
    - For Fastify, libraries like `fastify-swagger` can be integrated.

- **Auto-generating client SDKs from routes**

#### 4.1.4 Configuration Management (API & Keys)
- **API Keys:**
    - Generation: Securely generate API keys for `User` models.
    - Storage: Store API keys hashed in the database (e.g., using `bcrypt`). The actual key is shown to the user once upon creation.
- **Application Configuration:**
    - Manage API application settings (database connection strings, logging levels, JWT secrets if used later) via environment variables (e.g., using a `.env` file with `dotenv` library), consistent with Prisma's `DATABASE_URL` handling.

### 4.2 Core API Components & User Tracking

#### 4.2.1 Database Schema for User Tracking (to be added to `prisma/schema.prisma`)
Two new models will be introduced:

```prisma
// In prisma/schema.prisma

model User {
  id           String    @id @default(cuid()) // Or use autoincrement Int
  apiKey       String    @unique // For API authentication
  description  String?   // e.g., "Dashboard Primary Access", "Analyst X"
  createdAt    DateTime  @default(now())
  lastSeenAt   DateTime?
  isActive     Boolean   @default(true)
  activityLogs ActivityLog[]
  // Optional: Link to user-specific settings or saved wallet lists
}

model ActivityLog {
  id                 String    @id @default(cuid()) // Or use autoincrement Int
  userId             String
  user               User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  actionType         String    // e.g., 'get_wallet_summary', 'get_token_performance', 'run_pnl_analysis'
  timestamp          DateTime  @default(now())
  requestParameters  Json?     // Input parameters for the action
  status             String    // 'SUCCESS', 'FAILURE', 'INITIATED'
  durationMs         Int?      // Duration of the action
  errorMessage       String?
  sourceIp           String?   // Optional: for additional context

  @@index([userId])
  @@index([actionType])
  @@index([timestamp])
}
```

#### 4.2.2 Authentication
- Clients will include an `X-API-Key` header in requests.
- A middleware in the API framework will validate the API key against the `User` table and identify the `userId`.

#### 4.2.3 `DatabaseService` Enhancements (`src/services/database-service.ts`)
The existing `DatabaseService` will be augmented with methods to:
- Create and validate users/API keys.
- Record entries in the `ActivityLog` table (start, success, failure of actions).
- Update `lastSeenAt` for users.

### 4.3 API Endpoints (Illustrative)
All endpoints will be under a base path like `/api/v1/`.

#### 4.3.1 Wallet & General Information Endpoints
-   **`GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/summary`**: (Implemented)
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a comprehensive overview for a wallet, serving as the primary snapshot. It includes data for the "Sticky Summary Bar" and "General ACC Info" in a dashboard context. This endpoint also incorporates aggregated metrics previously envisioned for a separate `/aggregated-metrics` endpoint.
    *   **Data:** Wallet address, last active timestamp, days active (derived), key account-level performance indicators (e.g., latest PNL, token win rate from `AdvancedStatsResult`), a high-level behavior classification (from `BehaviorService`), and the full raw `AdvancedStatsResult` and `BehaviorMetrics` objects for clients needing more detail from this primary call.
    *   **Services Used:** `DatabaseService` (for `Wallet`, `AdvancedStatsResult`), `BehaviorService`.
    *   **Data Derivation Notes for "Last Active" and "Days Active":**
        *   **Wallet's "Last Active Timestamp":** Determined based on `Wallet.newestProcessedTimestamp` or the run timestamp from `AdvancedStatsResult`.
        *   **Wallet's "Analyzed Range":** `Wallet.analyzedTimestampStart` to `Wallet.analyzedTimestampEnd` now accurately reflects the period covered by the last canonical PNL analysis.
        *   **Wallet's "Days Active":** Calculated based on `Wallet.firstProcessedTimestamp` and the last active timestamp.
-   **`GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/info`**: (Potentially merged into summary or separate for more static details - currently merged into `/summary`)

#### Next Endpoints to Implement (Dashboard Focus - after immediate focus tasks):

1.  **`GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/token-performance`**: (Implemented - details below for completeness)
    *   **Plan Reference:** Section 4.3.2.
    *   **Purpose:** Powers the "aggregated data on token level" view for the dashboard.
    *   **Data:** Paginated and sortable list of token performance records from the latest `AnalysisResult` for the given wallet. Includes fields like `tokenAddress`, `netAmountChange`, `netSolProfitLoss`, etc.
    *   **Query Params:** `page`, `pageSize`, `sortBy`, `sortOrder`.
    *   **Services Used:** `DatabaseService`, `TokenPerformanceService`.

2.  **`GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/pnl-overview`**: (Implemented - details below for completeness)
    *   **Purpose:** Provide a detailed Profit and Loss (PNL) overview for a wallet, distinct from the general summary.
    *   **Data Considerations:** Includes overall realized PNL, total SOL spent/received, swap-level win rates, trade volumes, and various advanced trading statistics derived by `PnlAnalysisService` (e.g., median PNL per token, profit consistency, efficiency scores). This offers an in-depth financial performance view.
    *   **Services Used:** `PnlAnalysisService`.
    *   **Note:** This endpoint provides detailed financial metrics that are complementary to the broader `/summary` endpoint.

#### 4.3.2 Token Performance View Endpoints
-   **`GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/token-performance`**: (Implemented)
    *   **Purpose:** Powers the "aggregated data on token level" view for the dashboard.
    *   **Data:** Paginated and sortable list of token performance records from the latest `AnalysisResult` for the given wallet. Includes fields like `tokenAddress`, `netAmountChange`, `netSolProfitLoss`, etc.
    *   **Query Params:** `page`, `pageSize`, `sortBy`, `sortOrder`.
    *   **Services Used:** `DatabaseService` (via `TokenPerformanceService`).

#### 4.3.3 Aggregated Metrics View Endpoints
-   **`GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/aggregated-metrics`**: (Consolidated into `/summary`)
    *   **Status:** This endpoint's intended functionality (comprehensive metrics from `AdvancedStatsResult` and other overall statistics) is now provided as part of the `GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/summary` endpoint (see section 4.3.1). No separate endpoint is planned.
    *   **Services Used:** N/A (Functionality covered by `DatabaseService` as used by `/summary`).

#### 4.3.4 Behavior View Endpoints
-   **`GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/behavior-analysis`**: (Implemented)
    *   **Purpose:** Powers the "behavior" view.
    *   **Data:** Structured output from `BehaviorService` including trader classification, pattern timelines, consistency metrics, efficiency scores, strategic tags, temporal behavior details. This will be more granular than the summary classification.
    *   **Services Used:** `BehaviorService`.

#### 4.3.5 Analysis Triggering Endpoints (Optional - for future dashboard control)
-   **Unified Trigger Pattern (Primary for Dashboard Interaction):**
    -   **`POST /analyses/wallets/{walletAddress}/trigger-analysis`**: (Future)
        *   **Purpose:** Allow the dashboard or other clients to initiate a new analysis (e.g., PNL & Stats, Behavior, or all relevant types) for a specific wallet, or to request a re-analysis of existing data. This endpoint enqueues the analysis task(s).
        *   **Request Body:** May include `analysisType: ('pnl' | 'behavior' | 'all')`, and type-specific configuration options (e.g., time range, parameters for `PnlAnalysisService` or `BehaviorService`). Could also include a flag like `forceRefetch: boolean` to control fetching of underlying transaction data.
        *   **Response:** `202 Accepted` with a `jobId` (e.g., `{ "jobId": "some-unique-identifier" }`).
        *   **Services Used:** An orchestrator service (or enhancements to `DatabaseService`) to create an `AnalysisJob` record (with status 'pending'), manage the workflow (e.g., fetching transactions if required, then running analyses), and add the job to a queue (see Phase 7 for Job Queue System).
    -   **`GET /analyses/jobs/{jobId}/status`**: (Future)
        *   **Purpose:** Allow the client to poll for the status of an analysis job initiated by `trigger-analysis`.
        *   **Response:** `{ "jobId": "...", "status": ("pending" | "running" | "completed" | "failed"), "progress": "...", "resultUrl": "..." (if completed, and if results aren't directly updating the main data store queried by GET display endpoints) }`.
        *   **Services Used:** `DatabaseService` (to query `AnalysisJob` status).
-   *(Note on other potential trigger endpoints: While older or separate systems might have individual, synchronous trigger endpoints like `POST /analyses/wallets/{walletAddress}/pnl`, these are **not** the primary mechanism for the dashboard. The dashboard should use the asynchronous Unified Trigger Pattern above to initiate analyses. The existing `GET` endpoints like `/pnl-overview`, `/behavior-analysis` are then used to display the results once the analysis job is complete).*

### 4.4 Service Layer Interaction
- API controllers/handlers (e.g., in `src/api/controllers/`) will:
    1. Perform request validation and parse parameters.
    2. Authenticate the request via API key, retrieve `userId`.
    3. Call `databaseService.logActivity()` at the start of the request, and then again for success/failure outcomes, capturing duration, request parameters, and `userId`.
    4. Instantiate and invoke the appropriate NestJS-wrapped service(s) from locations like `src/behavior/behavior.service.ts`, `src/database/database.service.ts`, etc.
    5. **Note on User Context in Services (Refinement of original Task 4 "Refactor Services for API User Context"):** 
        - Core underlying services (e.g., `OriginalBehaviorService` in `src/wallet_analysis/core/`) will generally remain agnostic to API `userId` and direct `logActivity` calls. This maintains their reusability for CLIs, workers, etc.
        - NestJS wrapper services (e.g., `src/behavior/behavior.service.ts`) that are directly called by API controllers will receive the `userId` if they orchestrate multiple distinct, significant sub-operations that require separate activity log entries beyond the main API call logging. For simple pass-through calls from the wrapper to an original service (like the current `BehaviorService.getWalletBehavior`), controller-level logging is sufficient.
        - The original services will not be modified to directly accept `userId` for logging purposes unless a compelling case arises for a specific service where internal steps are complex and directly relevant to user-initiated API actions.
    6. Format service responses for the API.

### 4.5 Pre-computation vs. On-the-fly API Calculation
- The API will primarily serve pre-calculated data stored by the analysis scripts/services (e.g., `AnalysisResult`, `AdvancedStatsResult`).
- Minor data transformations, filtering, or combining results from different service calls can occur in the API layer or services.
- Computationally intensive analysis will continue to be handled by the core analyzers and services, with results persisted to the database. The API can trigger these processes if `Analysis Triggering Endpoints` are implemented.

### 4.6 Relationship with Existing Scripts
- **Coexistence:** Existing scripts (e.g., `activityCorrelator.ts`, `helius-analyzer.ts`) can continue to operate for batch processing, scheduled tasks, or direct CLI use.
- **API for On-Demand:** The API layer primarily serves interactive, on-demand requests, typical of a dashboard interface.
- **Future Evolution:** Some script functionalities might eventually be triggerable via the API or refactored to use API endpoints for consistency, but this is not an immediate priority. The focus is on exposing read-heavy data and core analysis results via the API first.

## Phase 5: Dashboard Integration (Ongoing - Current Focus)

**Goal:** Develop a web-based dashboard that consumes the API layer to provide users with insights into wallet analysis data, focusing on intuitive UX, high-signal data presentation, and rapid insight extraction.

**Guiding Principles (from `docs/dash_details_thoughts.md`):**
- **Insight-Driven Design:** Every element should serve insight extraction, not just data presentation. Structure, labels, and navigation must accelerate pattern recognition and minimize friction.
- **Data Prioritization (Cognitive Flow Hierarchy):**
    - Top Left (Identity): Wallet address, balance, linked socials, active status (anchoring trust and relevance).
    - Top Right (Snapshot Metrics): P&L delta, winrate, behavior tag (e.g., "high-frequency sniper", "passive holder").
- **Metric Design (Insight Density):** Focus on ratio metrics and change metrics (e.g., winrate-to-volume ratio, profit consistency). Use clear visual cues (colors, icons) for trends.
- **Time Filter:** A single, master time filter affecting all dashboard panels, with sensible defaults and presets.
- **Behavioral Insight Presentation:** Use descriptive labels (e.g., "How Often This Wallet Acts") and comparative tags (e.g., "Faster than 82% of wallets").
- **UX Flow Optimization:** Collapsible sidebar, ubiquitous tooltips, hover-to-reveal context, and click-to-drilldown functionality.
- **Modular & Composable Components:** Prioritize data clarity and minimalism. Avoid visual clutter.

### 5.1 Dashboard Technology Stack & Architecture

-   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
-   **Styling:** TailwindCSS
-   **Core Component Library:** shadcn/ui (for primitives like tabs, buttons, dropdowns, cards, tables, date pickers)
-   **Metric Display & Layout Blocks:** Tremor (for clean metrics display, cards, grids, flex components)
-   **Charting:** Apache ECharts (for advanced/custom behavioral and temporal charts, e.g., heatmaps, bar ranges, session clusters) and mini sparkline charts (Tremor-compatible or simple ECharts) within metric cards.
    *   **Recommendation:** Develop a reusable `ChartWrapper` component or abstraction layer early (e.g., during Week 3). This wrapper should standardize common props (e.g., data, themes, loading states, error handling) and encapsulate ECharts instance setup and updates to reduce boilerplate, improve maintainability, and ensure consistency across different charts. - **COMPLETE (`EChartComponent.tsx` created)**
-   **Data Fetching:** SWR or React Query (for robust API integration, caching, and state synchronization).
    *   **Consideration for Data Schema Evolution:** Implement robust data handling strategies, including:
        *   Type guards for API response validation.
        *   Error boundaries at component and view levels.
        *   Graceful degradation or fallback UIs if expected data fields are missing or malformed, especially if the backend API schema is still evolving.
-   **State Management:** Zustand or React Context (for global state like selected wallet, time filter, and shared UI state; prefer lightweight options)

### 5.2 Dashboard Structure and API Mapping (based on user diagram and `dash_details_thoughts.md`)

-   **Sidebar (Collapsible):**
    *   Navigation: Wallet selection/repository, Wallet List, Settings, Documentation, Help/About.
    *   Implementation: shadcn/ui components. - **COMPLETE. Enhancements: Tooltips added for collapsed state. "Settings" and "Help" moved to a visually distinct footer group.** (If sidebar is still "full of shit", a specific new issue needs to be raised under UX Polish).
-   **Main Window - Top Section (Sticky Summary Bar):**
    *   **Left Part: General Account Info:** Wallet address, balance, linked socials (if available).
        *   Data: Primarily from `GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/summary`.
    *   **Right Part: Account Summary Snapshot:** Last active date, P&L snapshot (e.g., 24h/7d change), key behavior profile/category tag.
        *   Data: Primarily from `GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/summary`.
    *   Implementation: Tremor `Card`, `Metric`, `Text`, `Flex`, `Grid` components. - **COMPLETE. Section is now collapsible. `AccountSummaryCard.tsx` significantly refined for compactness (prioritizing PNL, Win Rate, Balance), added tooltips for secondary info (Last Active, Behavior; "Days Active" removed), and implemented user-provided HTML structure for secondary info grid and tooltips.**
-   **Universal Time Filter:** - **LARGELY COMPLETE** (Functionality is there, minor UI polish or preset adjustments could be ongoing)
-   **Main Window - Bottom Section (Tabbed Data Views):**
    *   Container: `WalletTabsContainer` using shadcn/ui `Tabs` component. - **COMPLETE. Tab bar made slimmer with reduced padding, subtle background, icons next to labels, and tooltips on triggers.** (Active tab styling remains a separate visual issue if not resolved by other means).
    *   **Tab 1: Token Performance** - **COMPLETE**
    *   **Tab 2: Account Stats & PNL** - **COMPLETE** (Marked as LARGELY COMPLETE earlier, but based on functionality, it seems complete. Further polish is in the UX list).
    *   **Tab 3: Behavioral Patterns** - **COMPLETE**
    *   **Tab 4: Reviewer Log / Notes** - **COMPLETE**

#### 5.2.1 Consistent UI States: Guidelines for Loading, Empty, and Error Handling

This section outlines the design principles, visual guidelines, and specific scenarios for implementing consistent loading, empty, and error states across the dashboard. The goal is to provide a professional, informative, and predictable user experience. The primary component for many of these states is `dashboard/src/components/shared/EmptyState.tsx`.

**A. Design Principles:**

1.  **Clarity:** Users should immediately understand what is happening (e.g., "Loading data...", "No transactions found for this period.", "Could not fetch wallet summary.").
2.  **Consistency:** Similar situations should be handled with similar visual cues and messaging patterns across the application.
3.  **Guidance:** When possible, states should guide the user towards a resolution or next step (e.g., "Try adjusting your filters," "Retry analysis," "Check API Key configuration.").
4.  **Non-Disruptiveness:** Loading and error states should be presented in a way that minimizes user frustration. For partial content loading, consider inline indicators or skeleton loaders over full-screen overlays.
5.  **Professionalism:** States should maintain the overall look and feel of the application.

**B. Visual Guidelines & Component Usage:**

1.  **`EmptyState.tsx` Component:**
    *   **Variants:** Utilize the predefined variants (`default`, `error`, `info`, `playful`, `loading`) appropriately.
        *   `default` (often with `icon={Loader2}`): For general loading states of entire tabs or main content cards.
        *   `error`: For API errors or critical client-side errors.
        *   `info`: For informational messages, like "No data available," "Data not yet generated," or specific contextual information.
        *   `playful`: Can be used for empty states where a more engaging or less formal message is appropriate (e.g., a brand new user with no wallets - currently not a primary use case in data-heavy tabs).
    *   **Props:**
        *   `icon`: Use appropriate Lucide icons (e.g., `Loader2` for loading, `AlertTriangle` for error, `Info` or `SearchX` for info/no results).
        *   `title`: Clear, concise title for the state.
        *   `description`: Further explanation or guidance.
        *   `actionButton`: Include if a direct call to action is relevant (e.g., "Retry", "Analyze Wallet"). Associated props: `onActionClick`, `isActionLoading`.

2.  **Skeleton Loaders (shadcn/ui `Skeleton`):**
    *   While `EmptyState` with `Loader2` is the primary mechanism for loading entire tabs or main card components, `Skeleton` components *can* be used for more granular, component-level loading states where the structure of the content is known (e.g., simulating text lines or simple shapes within a component before its specific data arrives). This provides a UX enhancement by showing the shape of the content to come. Currently, this is not widely implemented for main content blocks but remains a good practice for smaller, internal parts.

3.  **Toasts (shadcn/ui `useToast`):**
    *   For non-modal notifications like success messages (e.g., "Wallet added to favorites," "Analysis started"), warnings, or less critical errors that don't require a full `EmptyState` display.
    *   Use `variant: 'destructive'` for error toasts.

4.  **Inline Indicators:**
    *   For very localized loading (e.g., a single metric updating, or search input loading indicator), a small spinner (`Loader2` icon with `animate-spin`) next to the element can be less intrusive. (As seen in `WalletSearch.tsx`).

5.  **Button States (shadcn/ui `Button`):**
    *   Utilize the `disabled` prop and embed a `Loader2` icon (with `animate-spin`) within buttons that trigger asynchronous actions to provide visual feedback during the action (e.g., "Import & Analyze" button in `WalletSearch.tsx`).

**C. Specific Scenarios & Recommended Messages/Actions:**

1.  **Loading States:**
    *   **Full Page/Tab/Main Card Loading:**
        *   **Visual:** `EmptyState` component with `variant="default"` and `icon={Loader2}`.
        *   **Title:** "Loading [Page/Tab Name]..." or "Loading Data..." (e.g., "Loading Token Performance...", "Loading PNL Data...").
        *   **Description:** (Optional but recommended) "Please wait while we fetch the latest data." or a more specific message.
    *   **Component-Level Loading (e.g., a specific chart or complex internal part of a card, if not using the main EmptyState):**
        *   **Visual:** `Skeleton` components matching the component's structure, or a compact `EmptyState` with `variant="default"` and `icon={Loader2}`, or an inline spinner.
        *   **Title (if `EmptyState` used):** "Loading..."
    *   **Background Data Refresh (SWR revalidation):**
        *   Generally, no explicit global loading state is needed if data is already displayed. User-initiated refreshes that take noticeable time provide feedback via button states (e.g., "Refresh Wallet Analysis" button in `WalletProfileLayout.tsx`).
    *   **Global Analysis In Progress (`isAnalyzingGlobal`):**
        *   **Visual:** `EmptyState` component with `variant="default"` and `icon={Loader2}`.
        *   **Title:** "Analyzing Wallet..."
        *   **Description:** "Please wait while the wallet analysis is in progress. [Specific data type, e.g., PNL data] will update shortly."

2.  **Empty States:**
    *   **No Data for Selected Criteria (e.g., filters, time range):**
        *   **Visual:** `EmptyState` with `info` variant.
        *   **Icon:** `SearchX` or `Info`.
        *   **Title:** "No Data Found" or "No [Items] Match Your Criteria" (e.g., "No Transactions Match Your Filters", "No Data Found for Applied Filters").
        *   **Description:** "Try adjusting your filters or expanding the time range."
        *   **Action:** (Optional) Button to "Clear Filters" or "Reset View."
    *   **New Wallet / Data Not Yet Generated (after analysis, but specific data is missing or initial state):**
        *   **Visual:** `EmptyState` with `info` variant.
        *   **Icon:** `Info`, `SearchX`, or a relevant icon like `Users` (for behavior).
        *   **Title:** "[Data Type] Not Yet Available/Generated" (e.g., "PNL Data Not Yet Available", "Behavioral Profile Not Generated", "PNL Data Not Generated").
        *   **Description:** Provides context, e.g., "Comprehensive PNL data is not available for this wallet yet. It may need to be analyzed to generate these insights." or "PNL data has not been generated for this wallet, or no activity falls within the selected period. Please analyze the wallet." or detailed explanations like in `AccountStatsPnlTab.tsx` based on `lastAnalysisTimestamp`.
        *   **Action:** `Button` "Analyze Wallet" or "Refresh Wallet Data" (triggers analysis API).
    *   **No Transactions Found (after analysis, for a specific period where applicable):**
        *   **Visual:** `EmptyState` with `info` variant.
        *   **Icon:** `Info` or `SearchX`.
        *   **Title:** "No Transactions Recorded" or similar.
        *   **Description:** "There were no transactions for this wallet within the selected period."
    *   **No Search Results (e.g., wallet search in sidebar):**
        *   **Component:** `WalletSearch.tsx` handles this with inline text and an "Import & Analyze" button.
        *   **Message Example:** "No wallets found matching "{query}"."
        *   **Action:** "Import & Analyze" button.
    *   **Empty Favorite Wallets List:**
        *   **Component:** `FavoriteWalletsList.tsx` handles this using a structure similar to `EmptyState`.
        *   **Message Example:** "No favorite wallets yet." (Icon: `Star`).
    *   **API Key Not Configured (for features requiring it):**
        *   **Visual:** `EmptyState` (or similar custom div structure as in `FavoriteWalletsList` and `WalletSearch`).
        *   **Icon:** `Info`.
        *   **Title:** "API Key Required" or similar.
        *   **Description:** "This feature requires API Key configuration. Please set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY."

3.  **Error States:**
    *   **API Errors (Failed to fetch data for a tab/component):**
        *   **Visual:** `EmptyState` with `error` variant.
        *   **Icon:** `AlertTriangle`.
        *   **Title:** "Error Loading Data" or "Could Not Fetch [Data Type]" (e.g., "Error Loading Behavioral Data", "Error Fetching PNL Data").
        *   **Description:** User-friendly message like `error.message` or a default like "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again." (Optionally include status code if helpful and not too technical).
        *   **Action:** `Button` "Retry Analysis" or "Retry" (re-fetches data or triggers analysis).
    *   **Specific 404 Errors (Data not found, distinct from general empty state):**
        *   Many components handle 404s by showing a specific `EmptyState` with an `info` variant, guiding the user to analyze the wallet (e.g., "PNL Data Not Yet Available" or "Behavioral Profile Not Generated"). This is preferable to a generic error for 404s where analysis is the solution.
    *   **Client-Side Processing Errors (Unexpected error in component):**
        *   **Visual:** `EmptyState` with `error` variant or a React Error Boundary for more critical failures.
        *   **Icon:** `AlertTriangle`.
        *   **Title:** "An Unexpected Error Occurred"
        *   **Description:** "Something went wrong while displaying this section. Please try refreshing the page."
    *   **Specific Action Failure (e.g., failing to add a favorite, trigger analysis from search):**
        *   **Visual:** Toast notification with `variant: 'destructive'`.
        *   **Title:** "Action Failed" (e.g., "Failed to Add Favorite", "Analysis error").
        *   **Description:** Brief reason from `error.message`.

**D. Testing Strategy Integration:**

*   During the "Comprehensive Review & Implementation Pass" (Task 3), each component will be tested against these scenarios:
    *   **Loading:** Simulate delayed API responses or use Storybook/testing utilities to force loading states. Verify correct display of skeletons or loading messages.
    *   **Empty:** Mock API responses with empty datasets or set up application state to reflect no data conditions. Verify appropriate empty state messages and CTAs.
    *   **Error:** Mock API error responses (e.g., 404, 500, network error) or introduce client-side errors. Verify correct error messages, icons, and retry mechanisms.
*   Check for console errors or warnings related to unhandled states.
*   Ensure consistency in terminology, iconography, and layout across all states.

### 5.3 Development Plan & Execution Steps (4-Week Iterative Cycle Example)

**Overarching Goals:**

### 5.4 Future Enhancements (Post-Initial Build)
-   **Wallet Comparison View:** Ability to select two wallets and see their key metrics/tabs side-by-side.
-   **Leaderboards/Segment Comparison:** Compare selected wallet against predefined segments (e.g., top 10% PNL).
-   **Advanced Chart Interactions:** Drill-downs within charts, cross-filtering.
-   **User-Savable Views/Filters.**
-   **Integration with AI Assistant (Phase 6):** Expose dashboard data/queries to the LLM.
-   **Favorite Wallets Scalability:** Plan for and implement a more scalable solution for displaying a large number of favorite wallets. Options to consider include:
    *   A "View All Favorites" link in the sidebar that navigates to a dedicated page for managing and viewing all favorites, especially if the number exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 20 items).
    *   Implementing virtual scrolling or pagination within the sidebar component itself if a dedicated page is not desired for the initial enhancement.
    *   Adding search/filter functionality within the favorites list.

### 5.5 Relationship with Existing Scripts & API
- This dashboard exclusively consumes the API layer defined in Phase 4.
- No direct database access from the frontend.
- All computationally intensive analysis is performed by backend services, with results served via API.
- The dashboard **must** be able to trigger re-analysis for a wallet. This will use the unified analysis triggering endpoints (defined in 4.3.5: `POST /analyses/wallets/{walletAddress}/trigger-analysis` and `GET /analyses/jobs/{jobId}/status`). The UI must provide clear feedback to the user about the status of these background jobs. (PAY EXTRA ATTENTION TO THIS - WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE ANALYSIS, FETCHING AND RE-ANALYSIS) - **This is a FUTURE item, as analysis triggering endpoints are marked (Future).** - **COMPLETE**

## Phase 6: AI Assistant Integration (Experimental Pilot) >>> IMPORTANT: check before start working docs\behavioral_reconstruction_task.md

**Goal:** Explore and validate the value of an LLM-based AI assistant for natural language querying of analysis data and generating summaries, leveraging the established API layer.

**Trigger:** Core API endpoints are stable and initial dashboard views are functional, providing a clear understanding of available data and user interaction patterns.

**Prerequisites:**
- Stable API Layer (Phase 4 completed for core read endpoints).
- Well-defined data models and metrics (from Phases 1-3 and `prisma/schema.prisma`).
- Initial Dashboard implementation (Phase 5.1 and 5.2 underway) to inform valuable AI use cases.

**Recommended Timing:** Commence exploration during or after initial dashboard milestones (e.g., after Phase 5.2, when key dashboard views are connected to the API).

**Approach & Smart Choices:**
- **Tool-Based LLM Interaction:** Utilize a structured approach for LLM interaction, such as Anthropic's model context protocol or similar frameworks that allow defining tools for the LLM.
- **API as the Primary Tool Source:** Design LLM tools primarily as wrappers around the existing, validated API endpoints (developed in Phase 4).
    - *Example:* An LLM tool `getWalletPNLSummary(wallet_address: string)` would internally call the `GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/summary` API endpoint.
- **Focus on Read-Only Operations Initially:** Prioritize use cases like natural language querying and data summarization. Defer AI-driven actions (e.g., triggering new analyses) until read capabilities are mature and robust.
- **Isolate AI Components:** Develop AI integration as a distinct module or service to allow for independent iteration and experimentation without destabilizing core application logic or the primary dashboard.
- **Iterative Development & Prompt Engineering:** Treat as an experimental feature. Expect an iterative process of refining prompts, tools, and handling LLM responses.

**Potential Initial Use Cases:**
- Natural language queries for specific metrics: "What was wallet X's win rate last month?" or "Show me the PNL for SOL for wallet Y."
- Automated summaries of wallet behavior or performance based on available API data.
- Conversational exploration of data presented in the dashboard.

**Considerations for Technical Debt & Overhead:**
- **Avoid Direct Database Access by LLM:** Enforce LLM interaction via the API to maintain security, abstraction, and maintainability.
- **Start Small & Focused:** Begin with a few high-impact, low-complexity use cases to demonstrate value and refine the integration approach.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** For complex queries or sensitive data synthesis, consider HITL mechanisms initially to validate AI outputs.

## Phase 7: Performance & Asynchronous Operations (Future Enhancement)

**Trigger:** API endpoints for triggering new analyses (see 4.3.5) become slow or block client requests for too long; need to process multiple analysis requests concurrently without overwhelming system resources.

**Smart Choices (aligned with `docs/scaling.md` Phase 2):

### 7.1 Job Queue System Introduction
- **Technology:** Introduce a job queue system (e.g., BullMQ) with Redis as the broker.
- **Purpose:** Offload long-running analysis tasks (PNL, Behavior, Correlation, Similarity) initiated via API calls to background workers.

### 7.2 API Integration with Job Queue
- API endpoints that trigger analyses (e.g., `POST /analyses/wallets/{walletAddress}/pnl`) will now:
    1. Validate the request and parameters.
    2. Add a job to the appropriate queue (e.g., `pnl-analysis-queue`).
    3. Return an immediate response (e.g., `202 Accepted` with a job ID).
- New API endpoints might be needed to check the status of a job (`GET /analyses/jobs/{jobId}`).

### 7.3 Worker Services Implementation
- Develop separate Node.js worker processes for each type of analysis or a generic worker that can handle different job types.
- Workers will listen to their respective queues.
- Upon receiving a job, a worker will:
    1. Instantiate and use the relevant services (`PnlAnalysisService`, `BehaviorService`, etc.) to perform the analysis.
    2. Update the job status in the queue and potentially in the `AnalysisRun` table in the database.
    3. Handle errors gracefully and update job status accordingly.

### 7.4 Benefits
- **Non-blocking API:** Improves API responsiveness for analysis-triggering requests.
- **Scalability:** Worker processes can be scaled independently based on load.
- **Resilience:** Jobs can be retried if workers fail (if queue is configured for retries).

## Phase 8: Advanced Database Scalability & Optimization (Future Enhancement)

**Trigger:** SQLite performance degrades significantly with a very large volume of transactions across many wallets; write contention becomes an issue; complex analytical queries for the dashboard become too slow despite optimizations.

**Smart Choices (aligned with `docs/scaling.md` Phase 4):

### 8.1 Database Migration to PostgreSQL
- **Action:** Use Prisma's migration capabilities to transition the database from SQLite to PostgreSQL.
- **Benefits:** PostgreSQL offers superior concurrency, scalability, robustness, and advanced features suitable for larger datasets and higher transaction volumes.
- **Impact:** Application code using Prisma Client will remain largely unchanged, demonstrating the power of the ORM.

### 8.2 Advanced Caching Layer
- **Technology:** Expand the use of Redis (introduced with job queues) or a similar caching solution.
- **Strategy:** Implement caching for frequently accessed, computationally expensive, or relatively static data:
    - Wallet summaries or frequently requested aggregated metrics from the API.
    - Results of common queries to `DatabaseService`.
- **Invalidation:** Develop a clear cache invalidation strategy to ensure data consistency.

### 8.3 Analytical Acceleration (If Required for Complex Dashboarding)
- **Context:** If dashboard queries remain slow even with PostgreSQL and caching, for highly complex, read-heavy analytics.
- **Options:**
    - **DuckDB:** For local or embedded analytics, potentially querying Parquet exports or a read replica of PostgreSQL.
    - **ETL + Data Warehouse (for very large scale):** Implement an ETL process to move data from PostgreSQL to a specialized analytical store (e.g., ClickHouse, BigQuery) if the application evolves into a large multi-user service requiring extensive BI capabilities. This is a significant architectural step and considered far-future.
