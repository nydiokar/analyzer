# Wallet Analysis System Refactoring Implementation Plan (Revised)

**Status Update (as of current conversation):** Core logic extraction is largely complete. Scripts are refactored. Key API endpoints are up. Dashboard integration is progressing. **A significant recent update involved refining how the system tracks the analyzed period for wallets: introduced `analyzedTimestampStart` and `analyzedTimestampEnd` to the `Wallet` model, replacing previous, more ambiguous fields. This fixed a critical bug where P/L analysis (especially with `--fetchOlder`) was incorrectly skipped. The `helius-analyzer.ts` script and `PnlAnalysisService` now use this improved state management. `HeliusSyncService` correctly sets overall fetched boundaries.** User/ActivityLog, balance fetching, and initial dashboard tabs are also in place. **The Analysis Triggering API Endpoint & Frontend Integration (formerly Immediate Focus item #1) is now COMPLETE.** **The Basic Sidebar Wallet Navigation task (Task #2) has seen significant progress, detailed below.** For detailed status on dashboard components and UI refinements, please see Phase 5.

## Recently Completed (Backend & Initial Dashboard Setup)

*   Core backend refactoring, API development, and initial dashboard setup are largely complete. Specific dashboard component completions and UI refinements are detailed within **Phase 5: Dashboard Integration**.
*   **Analysis Triggering API Endpoint & Frontend Integration:** Task completed. This involved creating the `POST /api/v1/analyses/wallets/:walletAddress/trigger-analysis` backend endpoint. On the frontend, `WalletProfileLayout.tsx` now includes a trigger button with loading/toast feedback, SWR cache revalidation, and display of the last analysis time/status. Backend `WalletsController.getWalletSummary` was also refined to reliably provide `lastAnalyzedAt`.


# ======== Immediate focus ==========

This section outlines the critical tasks for the upcoming development cycle(s), prioritized to enhance core functionality and user experience.

### High Priority (Next Working Session Focus)

1.  **Implement Analysis Triggering API Endpoint & Frontend Integration (Simplified Initial Version):** - **COMPLETE**
    *   **Summary of Completion:** The backend API endpoint (`POST /api/v1/analyses/wallets/:walletAddress/trigger-analysis`) was implemented in `AnalysesController`, successfully leveraging dependency injection for `HeliusSyncService`, `PnlAnalysisService`, and `BehaviorService`. The frontend integration in `WalletProfileLayout.tsx` provides a user-initiated trigger button, visual feedback (loading states, toasts), and updates the display of the last analysis time and status by revalidating SWR caches. The underlying DI issues (related to `@Injectable()` decorators and module configurations for Helius, PNL Analysis, and Analyses modules) were resolved as part of this task.

2.  **Implement Basic Sidebar Wallet Navigation (Search & Favorite Wallets):** - **PARTIALLY COMPLETE / IN PROGRESS**
    *   **Goal:** Improve wallet discovery and navigation within the dashboard.
    *   **Status & Summary:**
        *   **Wallet Search:**
            *   **Backend:** `GET /api/v1/wallets/search?query=<search_term>` implemented. Searches `Wallet` table for matching addresses. - **COMPLETE**
            *   **Frontend:** Sidebar search input (`WalletSearch.tsx`) calls the API, displays results, and allows navigation. If a wallet isn't found, an "Import & Analyze" button appears, calling the trigger-analysis API. When the sidebar is collapsed, the search functionality is available via a popover, triggered by a search icon with a tooltip. - **COMPLETE**
        *   **"Recent List" evolved into "Favorite Wallets":**
            *   **Backend:**
                *   `UserFavoriteWallet` join table added to `prisma/schema.prisma`. - **COMPLETE**
                *   API endpoints for managing user-specific favorites implemented under `/api/v1/users/me/favorites`:
                    *   `POST /users/me/favorites` (Add favorite) - **COMPLETE**
                    *   `DELETE /users/me/favorites/{walletAddress}` (Remove favorite) - **COMPLETE**
                    *   `GET /users/me/favorites` (List favorites, includes PNL/summary data) - **COMPLETE**
                *   Relevant DTOs and services (`UserFavoritesService`, `UserFavoritesController`) created and integrated. - **COMPLETE**
                *   `DatabaseService` updated with methods for favorite wallet operations. - **COMPLETE**
            *   **Frontend:**
                *   `FavoriteWalletsList.tsx` component created for the sidebar. - **COMPLETE**
                *   Uses SWR to fetch from `/api/v1/users/me/favorites`. - **COMPLETE**
                *   Displays favorite wallets with address, PNL, and score (if available). Allows removal. - **COMPLETE**
                *   When the sidebar is collapsed, favorites are accessible via a popover triggered by a star icon with a "Show Favorite Wallets" tooltip. - **COMPLETE**
                *   `WalletProfileLayout.tsx` has a star icon to add/remove the currently viewed wallet from favorites, using SWR with optimistic updates for a responsive UI. - **COMPLETE**

3.  **Define and Implement Consistent Loading, Empty, and Error States Across All Tabs/Components:** - **PARTIALLY COMPLETE / IN PROGRESS**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure a professional, informative, and consistent user experience during data fetching, when no data is available, or when errors occur.
    *   **Status & Summary:**
        *   **`EmptyState.tsx` Component:** A reusable component (`dashboard/src/components/shared/EmptyState.tsx`) with variants (default, error, info, playful) was created. - **COMPLETE**
        *   **Integration:**
            *   `BehavioralPatternsTab.tsx`: Updated with improved error/empty states and "Analyze Wallet" button. - **COMPLETE**
            *   `AccountStatsPnlTab.tsx`: Updated with user-friendly error/empty states and "Retry Analysis" button. - **COMPLETE**
            *   `AccountSummaryCard.tsx` (in `WalletProfileLayout.tsx`): Integrated `EmptyState` variants for its error/no-data states. - **COMPLETE**
            *   `FavoriteWalletsList.tsx`: Handles loading, error, empty, and API key not configured states. - **COMPLETE**
            *   `WalletSearch.tsx`: Handles loading, error, empty, and no results states, including "Import & Analyze" button. - **COMPLETE**
    *   **Tasks (Remaining/Documentation):**
        *   **Documentation:** Create a dedicated subsection (e.g., \"5.2.1 Consistent UI States\" if it was removed, or a new one) within this plan detailing the design principles, visual guidelines, and specific scenarios for:
            *   Loading States (full page/tab, partial/component, skeleton loaders).
            *   Empty States (no data for criteria, new wallet, no transactions, etc., with clear messages and potential calls to action like the \"Analyze This Wallet\" button).
            *   Error States (API errors, client-side errors, with clear messages, retry options, and consistent styling).
            *   Include common pitfalls and recommended solutions/components (e.g., using specific shadcn/ui or Tremor components).
        *   **Implementation & Review (Ongoing as new components are built):**
            *   Review any remaining/new dashboard tabs and components.
            *   Implement or update them to adhere to the defined guidelines for these states.
            *   Ensure consistency in visual appearance and messaging.

### Medium Priority (Follow-on or Parallel if capacity allows)

1.  **Basic "Wallet Comparison" / "Find Similar Wallets" Feature (Pilot):**
    *   **Goal:** Introduce initial functionality for comparing wallets or finding similar ones.
    *   **Backend Tasks:**
        *   Refactor `walletSimilarity.ts` script: Ensure its core logic is encapsulated in `SimilarityService` (as per Phase 2.1.3).
        *   Expose functionality via a new API endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/v1/wallets/{walletAddress}/find-similar` or a more general `POST /api/v1/similarity-analysis`).
    *   **Frontend Tasks:**
        *   Design a simple UI (e.g., a new section/tool accessible from the sidebar or a button on a wallet's view) to trigger this.
        *   Display the list of similar wallets with key comparable metrics.
    *   **Note:** This is a pilot; complexity should be contained.

2.  **AI Insights for Overview Tab (Conceptual Planning):**
    *   **Goal:** Begin conceptualizing how the "Overview" tab can be transformed into an AI-driven summary (aligns with Phase 6).
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Brainstorm specific insights an AI could generate using existing API data.
        *   Sketch potential UI layouts for presenting these AI-generated summaries.
        *   No immediate implementation, but gather ideas to inform Phase 6.

### Lower Priority (Defer for Now)

*   **Full Sidebar Enhancements:** Advanced features like user-savable wallet lists, fully functional "Settings" and "Documentation" pages (beyond basic navigation and search).
*   **Advanced Chart Aesthetic Refinements:** Detailed tweaks to chart appearances beyond basic clarity and consistency (e.g., log scale minimum padding, advanced tooltip designs).
*   **Specific Typography Details:** E.g., "Red indicators (â–¼) consistent baseline alignment" (a quick general review might occur during the UI states task, but deep dives are deferred).

- Uses `report_utils.ts` to generate and save various report types (individual behavior, comparative behavior, correlation, similarity).

### 2.2 Enhance Existing Services (Largely Complete)

- `DatabaseService`: Refactored into a class. Imports in older scripts like `helius-analyzer.ts` need updating. References to removed `lastSignatureAnalyzed` field were cleaned up. - **COMPLETE & VERIFIED**
- `HeliusApiClient`: Assumed functional based on plan. - **VERIFIED**
- `HeliusTransactionMapper`: Assumed functional based on plan. - **VERIFIED**

## Phase 3: Script Refactoring (Ongoing -> Largely Complete)

**Goal:** Transform scripts in `src/scripts/` to act as simple orchestrators or entry points that primarily call the new services.

### 3.1 `activityCorrelator.ts`
- **Status: Complete**
- The script now handles CLI argument parsing (wallet source, excludeMints, timeRange).
- It instantiates `DatabaseService`, `CorrelationService`, and `ReportingService`.
- It creates `CorrelationAnalysisConfig` with CLI args.
- It calls `reportingService.generateAndSaveCorrelationReport` to orchestrate the analysis and reporting.
- Internal logic for fetching, filtering, PNL calculation, analysis, clustering, and report generation has been removed.

### 3.2 `wallet-behavior-analyzer.ts`
- **Status: Complete** 
- The script now handles CLI argument parsing (walletAddress, label, excludeMints, timeRange).
- It instantiates `DatabaseService`, `BehaviorService`, and `ReportingService`.
- It creates `BehaviorAnalysisConfig` with CLI args.
- It calls `behaviorService.analyzeWalletBehavior`.
- It calls `reportingService.generateAndSaveIndividualBehaviorReport`.
- Internal logic for fetching, analysis, and reporting has been removed.

### 3.3 `kpi-comparison-report.ts`
- **Status: Complete** 
- The script now handles CLI argument parsing (walletList file, excludeMints, timeRange).
- It instantiates `DatabaseService`, `BehaviorService`, `KPIComparisonAnalyzer`, and `ReportingService`.
- It creates `BehaviorAnalysisConfig` with CLI args.
- It calls `reportingService.generateComparativeBehaviorReport`.
- Internal logic for fetching, analysis, and reporting has been removed.

### 3.4 `walletSimilarity.ts`
- **Status: To Do**
- **Goal:** Update `main` function to orchestrate service calls.
- **Required Refactoring Steps:**
    - Parse CLI args (wallet source, vector type, potentially timeRange/excludeMints).
    - Instantiate `DatabaseService` and `SimilarityService`.
    - Create `SimilarityAnalysisConfig` (potentially including timeRange/excludeMints).
    - Instantiate `ReportingService` (injecting `SimilarityService`).
    - Call `reportingService.generateAndSaveSimilarityReport(walletAddresses, vectorType)`.
    - Remove internal logic for fetching, shared token analysis, vector creation, similarity calc, and reporting.

### 3.5 `helius-analyzer.ts`
- **Status: Complete**
- **Description:** The script has been refactored to act as an orchestrator, leveraging dedicated services (`HeliusSyncService`, `PnlAnalysisService`, `ReportingService`, `DatabaseService`) for data synchronization, analysis, and reporting. **Crucially, its logic for determining whether to re-run P/L analysis has been updated to use the new `analyzedTimestampStart`/`analyzedTimestampEnd` fields in conjunction with overall fetched timestamps from `HeliusSyncService`, fixing previous issues with `--fetchOlder` and ensuring more robust re-analysis triggers.**
- **Key Components Used:**
    - `HeliusSyncService`: Manages data fetching, mapping, and storage. Its role in setting `firstProcessedTimestamp` and `newestProcessedTimestamp` on the `Wallet` model has been verified as correct for the new analysis trigger logic.
    - `PnlAnalysisService`: Orchestrates P/L and stats calculation. **It now correctly updates `analyzedTimestampStart` and `analyzedTimestampEnd` on the `Wallet` model after a successful analysis.**
    - `ReportingService`: Generates and saves Markdown/CSV reports.
    - `DatabaseService`: Used directly by the script for managing `AnalysisRun` records.
    - `cliUtils` / `displayUtils`: For parsing and displaying.
- **Refactoring Steps Taken (Summary):**
    1. Extracted core swap logic to `SwapAnalyzer`.
    2. Extracted core stats logic to `AdvancedStatsAnalyzer`.
    3. Created `HeliusSyncService` for data fetching/syncing (verified its wallet state updates).
    4. Created `PnlAnalysisService` for orchestrating analysis (updated its wallet state updates).
    5. Updated `ReportingService` and `report_utils.ts` for PNL reports.
    6. Refactored `helius-analyzer.ts` script to use these services and manage `AnalysisRun` persistence, **including the refined analysis trigger logic.**

## Phase 4: API Layer Implementation (COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Develop a robust API layer to expose analysis functionalities for client applications (e.g., dashboards), enable user tracking, and support scalable architecture. This phase transitions the system from script-driven to service-accessible.

### 4.1 API Design Principles & Technology

#### 4.1.1 Foundational Principles
- **RESTful Architecture:** Adhere to REST principles for resource naming, HTTP methods, and status codes.
- **Statelessness:** API endpoints will be stateless where possible, not relying on server-side session memory between requests.
- **Versioning:** API endpoints will be versioned (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) to allow for future iterations without breaking existing clients.
- **Consistent Error Handling:** Implement a standardized error response format.
- **Authentication:** Secure endpoints using API key-based authentication.

#### 4.1.2 API Technology Stack & Framework Selection
- **Context:** The backend is TypeScript-based, utilizing Prisma. The API layer should integrate seamlessly.
- **Recommendation:** A Node.js framework is highly recommended.
    - **NestJS:** An opinionated, TypeScript-first framework promoting robust architectural patterns (modules, services, controllers) that align well with the existing service-oriented structure. Provides strong out-of-the-box support for OpenAPI (Swagger) generation, validation, and more.

#### 4.1.3 API Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- **Requirement:** Implement automated generation of OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation from the outset. 
- **Benefits:** Provides a live, accurate API reference crucial for dashboard developers, simplifies development, testing, and future maintenance.
- **Implementation:** 
    - If NestJS is chosen, it has excellent built-in support.
    - For Fastify, libraries like `fastify-swagger` can be integrated.

- **Auto-generating client SDKs from routes**

#### 4.1.4 Configuration Management (API & Keys)
- **API Keys:**
    - Generation: Securely generate API keys for `User` models.
    - Storage: Store API keys hashed in the database (e.g., using `bcrypt`). The actual key is shown to the user once upon creation.
- **Application Configuration:**
    - Manage API application settings (database connection strings, logging levels, JWT secrets if used later) via environment variables (e.g., using a `.env` file with `dotenv` library), consistent with Prisma's `DATABASE_URL` handling.

### 4.2 Core API Components & User Tracking

#### 4.2.1 Database Schema for User Tracking (to be added to `prisma/schema.prisma`)
Two new models will be introduced:

```prisma
// In prisma/schema.prisma

model User {
  id           String    @id @default(cuid()) // Or use autoincrement Int
  apiKey       String    @unique // For API authentication
  description  String?   // e.g., "Dashboard Primary Access", "Analyst X"
  createdAt    DateTime  @default(now())
  lastSeenAt   DateTime?
  isActive     Boolean   @default(true)
  activityLogs ActivityLog[]
  // Optional: Link to user-specific settings or saved wallet lists
}

model ActivityLog {
  id                 String    @id @default(cuid()) // Or use autoincrement Int
  userId             String
  user               User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  actionType         String    // e.g., 'get_wallet_summary', 'get_token_performance', 'run_pnl_analysis'
  timestamp          DateTime  @default(now())
  requestParameters  Json?     // Input parameters for the action
  status             String    // 'SUCCESS', 'FAILURE', 'INITIATED'
  durationMs         Int?      // Duration of the action
  errorMessage       String?
  sourceIp           String?   // Optional: for additional context

  @@index([userId])
  @@index([actionType])
  @@index([timestamp])
}
```

#### 4.2.2 Authentication
- Clients will include an `X-API-Key` header in requests.
- A middleware in the API framework will validate the API key against the `User` table and identify the `userId`.

#### 4.2.3 `DatabaseService` Enhancements (`src/services/database-service.ts`)
The existing `DatabaseService` will be augmented with methods to:
- Create and validate users/API keys.
- Record entries in the `ActivityLog` table (start, success, failure of actions).
- Update `lastSeenAt` for users.

### 4.3 API Endpoints (Illustrative)
All endpoints will be under a base path like `/api/v1/`.

#### 4.3.1 Wallet & General Information Endpoints
-   **`GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/summary`**: (Implemented)
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a comprehensive overview for a wallet, serving as the primary snapshot. It includes data for the "Sticky Summary Bar" and "General ACC Info" in a dashboard context. This endpoint also incorporates aggregated metrics previously envisioned for a separate `/aggregated-metrics` endpoint.
    *   **Data:** Wallet address, last active timestamp, days active (derived), key account-level performance indicators (e.g., latest PNL, token win rate from `AdvancedStatsResult`), a high-level behavior classification (from `BehaviorService`), and the full raw `AdvancedStatsResult` and `BehaviorMetrics` objects for clients needing more detail from this primary call.
    *   **Services Used:** `DatabaseService` (for `Wallet`, `AdvancedStatsResult`), `BehaviorService`.
    *   **Data Derivation Notes for "Last Active" and "Days Active":**
        *   **Wallet's "Last Active Timestamp":** Determined based on `Wallet.newestProcessedTimestamp` or the run timestamp from `AdvancedStatsResult`.
        *   **Wallet's "Analyzed Range":** `Wallet.analyzedTimestampStart` to `Wallet.analyzedTimestampEnd` now accurately reflects the period covered by the last canonical PNL analysis.
        *   **Wallet's "Days Active":** Calculated based on `Wallet.firstProcessedTimestamp` and the last active timestamp.
-   **`GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/info`**: (Potentially merged into summary or separate for more static details - currently merged into `/summary`)

#### Next Endpoints to Implement (Dashboard Focus - after immediate focus tasks):

1.  **`GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/token-performance`**: (Implemented - details below for completeness)
    *   **Plan Reference:** Section 4.3.2.
    *   **Purpose:** Powers the "aggregated data on token level" view for the dashboard.
    *   **Data:** Paginated and sortable list of token performance records from the latest `AnalysisResult` for the given wallet. Includes fields like `tokenAddress`, `netAmountChange`, `netSolProfitLoss`, etc.
    *   **Query Params:** `page`, `pageSize`, `sortBy`, `sortOrder`.
    *   **Services Used:** `DatabaseService`, `TokenPerformanceService`.

2.  **`GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/pnl-overview`**: (Implemented - details below for completeness)
    *   **Purpose:** Provide a detailed Profit and Loss (PNL) overview for a wallet, distinct from the general summary.
    *   **Data Considerations:** Includes overall realized PNL, total SOL spent/received, swap-level win rates, trade volumes, and various advanced trading statistics derived by `PnlAnalysisService` (e.g., median PNL per token, profit consistency, efficiency scores). This offers an in-depth financial performance view.
    *   **Services Used:** `PnlAnalysisService`.
    *   **Note:** This endpoint provides detailed financial metrics that are complementary to the broader `/summary` endpoint.

#### 4.3.2 Token Performance View Endpoints
-   **`GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/token-performance`**: (Implemented)
    *   **Purpose:** Powers the "aggregated data on token level" view for the dashboard.
    *   **Data:** Paginated and sortable list of token performance records from the latest `AnalysisResult` for the given wallet. Includes fields like `tokenAddress`, `netAmountChange`, `netSolProfitLoss`, etc.
    *   **Query Params:** `page`, `pageSize`, `sortBy`, `sortOrder`.
    *   **Services Used:** `DatabaseService` (via `TokenPerformanceService`).

#### 4.3.3 Aggregated Metrics View Endpoints
-   **`GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/aggregated-metrics`**: (Consolidated into `/summary`)
    *   **Status:** This endpoint's intended functionality (comprehensive metrics from `AdvancedStatsResult` and other overall statistics) is now provided as part of the `GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/summary` endpoint (see section 4.3.1). No separate endpoint is planned.
    *   **Services Used:** N/A (Functionality covered by `DatabaseService` as used by `/summary`).

#### 4.3.4 Behavior View Endpoints
-   **`GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/behavior-analysis`**: (Implemented)
    *   **Purpose:** Powers the "behavior" view.
    *   **Data:** Structured output from `BehaviorService` including trader classification, pattern timelines, consistency metrics, efficiency scores, strategic tags, temporal behavior details. This will be more granular than the summary classification.
    *   **Services Used:** `BehaviorService`.

#### 4.3.5 Analysis Triggering Endpoints (Optional - for future dashboard control)
-   **Unified Trigger Pattern (Primary for Dashboard Interaction):**
    -   **`POST /analyses/wallets/{walletAddress}/trigger-analysis`**: (Future)
        *   **Purpose:** Allow the dashboard or other clients to initiate a new analysis (e.g., PNL & Stats, Behavior, or all relevant types) for a specific wallet, or to request a re-analysis of existing data. This endpoint enqueues the analysis task(s).
        *   **Request Body:** May include `analysisType: ('pnl' | 'behavior' | 'all')`, and type-specific configuration options (e.g., time range, parameters for `PnlAnalysisService` or `BehaviorService`). Could also include a flag like `forceRefetch: boolean` to control fetching of underlying transaction data.
        *   **Response:** `202 Accepted` with a `jobId` (e.g., `{ "jobId": "some-unique-identifier" }`).
        *   **Services Used:** An orchestrator service (or enhancements to `DatabaseService`) to create an `AnalysisJob` record (with status 'pending'), manage the workflow (e.g., fetching transactions if required, then running analyses), and add the job to a queue (see Phase 7 for Job Queue System).
    -   **`GET /analyses/jobs/{jobId}/status`**: (Future)
        *   **Purpose:** Allow the client to poll for the status of an analysis job initiated by `trigger-analysis`.
        *   **Response:** `{ "jobId": "...", "status": ("pending" | "running" | "completed" | "failed"), "progress": "...", "resultUrl": "..." (if completed, and if results aren't directly updating the main data store queried by GET display endpoints) }`.
        *   **Services Used:** `DatabaseService` (to query `AnalysisJob` status).
-   *(Note on other potential trigger endpoints: While older or separate systems might have individual, synchronous trigger endpoints like `POST /analyses/wallets/{walletAddress}/pnl`, these are **not** the primary mechanism for the dashboard. The dashboard should use the asynchronous Unified Trigger Pattern above to initiate analyses. The existing `GET` endpoints like `/pnl-overview`, `/behavior-analysis` are then used to display the results once the analysis job is complete).*

### 4.4 Service Layer Interaction
- API controllers/handlers (e.g., in `src/api/controllers/`) will:
    1. Perform request validation and parse parameters.
    2. Authenticate the request via API key, retrieve `userId`.
    3. Call `databaseService.logActivity()` at the start of the request, and then again for success/failure outcomes, capturing duration, request parameters, and `userId`.
    4. Instantiate and invoke the appropriate NestJS-wrapped service(s) from locations like `src/behavior/behavior.service.ts`, `src/database/database.service.ts`, etc.
    5. **Note on User Context in Services (Refinement of original Task 4 "Refactor Services for API User Context"):** 
        - Core underlying services (e.g., `OriginalBehaviorService` in `src/wallet_analysis/core/`) will generally remain agnostic to API `userId` and direct `logActivity` calls. This maintains their reusability for CLIs, workers, etc.
        - NestJS wrapper services (e.g., `src/behavior/behavior.service.ts`) that are directly called by API controllers will receive the `userId` if they orchestrate multiple distinct, significant sub-operations that require separate activity log entries beyond the main API call logging. For simple pass-through calls from the wrapper to an original service (like the current `BehaviorService.getWalletBehavior`), controller-level logging is sufficient.
        - The original services will not be modified to directly accept `userId` for logging purposes unless a compelling case arises for a specific service where internal steps are complex and directly relevant to user-initiated API actions.
    6. Format service responses for the API.

### 4.5 Pre-computation vs. On-the-fly API Calculation
- The API will primarily serve pre-calculated data stored by the analysis scripts/services (e.g., `AnalysisResult`, `AdvancedStatsResult`).
- Minor data transformations, filtering, or combining results from different service calls can occur in the API layer or services.
- Computationally intensive analysis will continue to be handled by the core analyzers and services, with results persisted to the database. The API can trigger these processes if `Analysis Triggering Endpoints` are implemented.

### 4.6 Relationship with Existing Scripts
- **Coexistence:** Existing scripts (e.g., `activityCorrelator.ts`, `helius-analyzer.ts`) can continue to operate for batch processing, scheduled tasks, or direct CLI use.
- **API for On-Demand:** The API layer primarily serves interactive, on-demand requests, typical of a dashboard interface.
- **Future Evolution:** Some script functionalities might eventually be triggerable via the API or refactored to use API endpoints for consistency, but this is not an immediate priority. The focus is on exposing read-heavy data and core analysis results via the API first.

## Phase 5: Dashboard Integration (Ongoing - Current Focus)

**Goal:** Develop a web-based dashboard that consumes the API layer to provide users with insights into wallet analysis data, focusing on intuitive UX, high-signal data presentation, and rapid insight extraction.

**Guiding Principles (from `docs/dash_details_thoughts.md`):**
- **Insight-Driven Design:** Every element should serve insight extraction, not just data presentation. Structure, labels, and navigation must accelerate pattern recognition and minimize friction.
- **Data Prioritization (Cognitive Flow Hierarchy):**
    - Top Left (Identity): Wallet address, balance, linked socials, active status (anchoring trust and relevance).
    - Top Right (Snapshot Metrics): P&L delta, winrate, behavior tag (e.g., "high-frequency sniper", "passive holder").
- **Metric Design (Insight Density):** Focus on ratio metrics and change metrics (e.g., winrate-to-volume ratio, profit consistency). Use clear visual cues (colors, icons) for trends.
- **Time Filter:** A single, master time filter affecting all dashboard panels, with sensible defaults and presets.
- **Behavioral Insight Presentation:** Use descriptive labels (e.g., "How Often This Wallet Acts") and comparative tags (e.g., "Faster than 82% of wallets").
- **UX Flow Optimization:** Collapsible sidebar, ubiquitous tooltips, hover-to-reveal context, and click-to-drilldown functionality.
- **Modular & Composable Components:** Prioritize data clarity and minimalism. Avoid visual clutter.

### 5.1 Dashboard Technology Stack & Architecture

-   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
-   **Styling:** TailwindCSS
-   **Core Component Library:** shadcn/ui (for primitives like tabs, buttons, dropdowns, cards, tables, date pickers)
-   **Metric Display & Layout Blocks:** Tremor (for clean metrics display, cards, grids, flex components)
-   **Charting:** Apache ECharts (for advanced/custom behavioral and temporal charts, e.g., heatmaps, bar ranges, session clusters) and mini sparkline charts (Tremor-compatible or simple ECharts) within metric cards.
    *   **Recommendation:** Develop a reusable `ChartWrapper` component or abstraction layer early (e.g., during Week 3). This wrapper should standardize common props (e.g., data, themes, loading states, error handling) and encapsulate ECharts instance setup and updates to reduce boilerplate, improve maintainability, and ensure consistency across different charts. - **COMPLETE (`EChartComponent.tsx` created)**
-   **Data Fetching:** SWR or React Query (for robust API integration, caching, and state synchronization).
    *   **Consideration for Data Schema Evolution:** Implement robust data handling strategies, including:
        *   Type guards for API response validation.
        *   Error boundaries at component and view levels.
        *   Graceful degradation or fallback UIs if expected data fields are missing or malformed, especially if the backend API schema is still evolving.
-   **State Management:** Zustand or React Context (for global state like selected wallet, time filter, and shared UI state; prefer lightweight options)

### 5.2 Dashboard Structure and API Mapping (based on user diagram and `dash_details_thoughts.md`)

-   **Sidebar (Collapsible):**
    *   Navigation: Wallet selection/repository, Wallet List, Settings, Documentation, Help/About.
    *   Implementation: shadcn/ui components. - **COMPLETE. Enhancements: Tooltips added for collapsed state. "Settings" and "Help" moved to a visually distinct footer group.** (If sidebar is still "full of shit", a specific new issue needs to be raised under UX Polish).
-   **Main Window - Top Section (Sticky Summary Bar):**
    *   **Left Part: General Account Info:** Wallet address, balance, linked socials (if available).
        *   Data: Primarily from `GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/summary`.
    *   **Right Part: Account Summary Snapshot:** Last active date, P&L snapshot (e.g., 24h/7d change), key behavior profile/category tag.
        *   Data: Primarily from `GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/summary`.
    *   Implementation: Tremor `Card`, `Metric`, `Text`, `Flex`, `Grid` components. - **COMPLETE. Section is now collapsible. `AccountSummaryCard.tsx` significantly refined for compactness (prioritizing PNL, Win Rate, Balance), added tooltips for secondary info (Last Active, Behavior; "Days Active" removed), and implemented user-provided HTML structure for secondary info grid and tooltips.**
-   **Universal Time Filter:** - **LARGELY COMPLETE** (Functionality is there, minor UI polish or preset adjustments could be ongoing)
-   **Main Window - Bottom Section (Tabbed Data Views):**
    *   Container: `WalletTabsContainer` using shadcn/ui `Tabs` component. - **COMPLETE. Tab bar made slimmer with reduced padding, subtle background, icons next to labels, and tooltips on triggers.** (Active tab styling remains a separate visual issue if not resolved by other means).
    *   **Tab 1: Token Performance** - **COMPLETE**
    *   **Tab 2: Account Stats & PNL** - **COMPLETE** (Marked as LARGELY COMPLETE earlier, but based on functionality, it seems complete. Further polish is in the UX list).
    *   **Tab 3: Behavioral Patterns** - **COMPLETE**
    *   **Tab 4: Reviewer Log / Notes** - **COMPLETE**

### 5.4 Future Enhancements (Post-Initial Build)
-   **Wallet Comparison View:** Ability to select two wallets and see their key metrics/tabs side-by-side.
-   **Leaderboards/Segment Comparison:** Compare selected wallet against predefined segments (e.g., top 10% PNL).
-   **Advanced Chart Interactions:** Drill-downs within charts, cross-filtering.
-   **User-Savable Views/Filters.**
-   **Integration with AI Assistant (Phase 6):** Expose dashboard data/queries to the LLM.
-   **Favorite Wallets Scalability:** Plan for and implement a more scalable solution for displaying a large number of favorite wallets. Options to consider include:
    *   A "View All Favorites" link in the sidebar that navigates to a dedicated page for managing and viewing all favorites, especially if the number exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 20 items).
    *   Implementing virtual scrolling or pagination within the sidebar component itself if a dedicated page is not desired for the initial enhancement.
    *   Adding search/filter functionality within the favorites list.

### 5.5 Relationship with Existing Scripts & API
- This dashboard exclusively consumes the API layer defined in Phase 4.
- No direct database access from the frontend.
- All computationally intensive analysis is performed by backend services, with results served via API.
- The dashboard **must** be able to trigger re-analysis for a wallet. This will use the unified analysis triggering endpoints (defined in 4.3.5: `POST /analyses/wallets/{walletAddress}/trigger-analysis` and `GET /analyses/jobs/{jobId}/status`). The UI must provide clear feedback to the user about the status of these background jobs. (PAY EXTRA ATTENTION TO THIS - WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE ANALYSIS, FETCHING AND RE-ANALYSIS) - **This is a FUTURE item, as analysis triggering endpoints are marked (Future).**

## Phase 6: AI Assistant Integration (Experimental Pilot) >>> IMPORTANT: check before start working docs\behavioral_reconstruction_task.md

**Goal:** Explore and validate the value of an LLM-based AI assistant for natural language querying of analysis data and generating summaries, leveraging the established API layer.

**Trigger:** Core API endpoints are stable and initial dashboard views are functional, providing a clear understanding of available data and user interaction patterns.

**Prerequisites:**
- Stable API Layer (Phase 4 completed for core read endpoints).
- Well-defined data models and metrics (from Phases 1-3 and `prisma/schema.prisma`).
- Initial Dashboard implementation (Phase 5.1 and 5.2 underway) to inform valuable AI use cases.

**Recommended Timing:** Commence exploration during or after initial dashboard milestones (e.g., after Phase 5.2, when key dashboard views are connected to the API).

**Approach & Smart Choices:**
- **Tool-Based LLM Interaction:** Utilize a structured approach for LLM interaction, such as Anthropic's model context protocol or similar frameworks that allow defining tools for the LLM.
- **API as the Primary Tool Source:** Design LLM tools primarily as wrappers around the existing, validated API endpoints (developed in Phase 4).
    - *Example:* An LLM tool `getWalletPNLSummary(wallet_address: string)` would internally call the `GET /wallets/{walletAddress}/summary` API endpoint.
- **Focus on Read-Only Operations Initially:** Prioritize use cases like natural language querying and data summarization. Defer AI-driven actions (e.g., triggering new analyses) until read capabilities are mature and robust.
- **Isolate AI Components:** Develop AI integration as a distinct module or service to allow for independent iteration and experimentation without destabilizing core application logic or the primary dashboard.
- **Iterative Development & Prompt Engineering:** Treat as an experimental feature. Expect an iterative process of refining prompts, tools, and handling LLM responses.

**Potential Initial Use Cases:**
- Natural language queries for specific metrics: "What was wallet X's win rate last month?" or "Show me the PNL for SOL for wallet Y."
- Automated summaries of wallet behavior or performance based on available API data.
- Conversational exploration of data presented in the dashboard.

**Considerations for Technical Debt & Overhead:**
- **Avoid Direct Database Access by LLM:** Enforce LLM interaction via the API to maintain security, abstraction, and maintainability.
- **Start Small & Focused:** Begin with a few high-impact, low-complexity use cases to demonstrate value and refine the integration approach.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** For complex queries or sensitive data synthesis, consider HITL mechanisms initially to validate AI outputs.

## Phase 7: Performance & Asynchronous Operations (Future Enhancement)

**Trigger:** API endpoints for triggering new analyses (see 4.3.5) become slow or block client requests for too long; need to process multiple analysis requests concurrently without overwhelming system resources.

**Smart Choices (aligned with `docs/scaling.md` Phase 2):

### 7.1 Job Queue System Introduction
- **Technology:** Introduce a job queue system (e.g., BullMQ) with Redis as the broker.
- **Purpose:** Offload long-running analysis tasks (PNL, Behavior, Correlation, Similarity) initiated via API calls to background workers.

### 7.2 API Integration with Job Queue
- API endpoints that trigger analyses (e.g., `POST /analyses/wallets/{walletAddress}/pnl`) will now:
    1. Validate the request and parameters.
    2. Add a job to the appropriate queue (e.g., `pnl-analysis-queue`).
    3. Return an immediate response (e.g., `202 Accepted` with a job ID).
- New API endpoints might be needed to check the status of a job (`GET /analyses/jobs/{jobId}`).

### 7.3 Worker Services Implementation
- Develop separate Node.js worker processes for each type of analysis or a generic worker that can handle different job types.
- Workers will listen to their respective queues.
- Upon receiving a job, a worker will:
    1. Instantiate and use the relevant services (`PnlAnalysisService`, `BehaviorService`, etc.) to perform the analysis.
    2. Update the job status in the queue and potentially in the `AnalysisRun` table in the database.
    3. Handle errors gracefully and update job status accordingly.

### 7.4 Benefits
- **Non-blocking API:** Improves API responsiveness for analysis-triggering requests.
- **Scalability:** Worker processes can be scaled independently based on load.
- **Resilience:** Jobs can be retried if workers fail (if queue is configured for retries).

## Phase 8: Advanced Database Scalability & Optimization (Future Enhancement)

**Trigger:** SQLite performance degrades significantly with a very large volume of transactions across many wallets; write contention becomes an issue; complex analytical queries for the dashboard become too slow despite optimizations.

**Smart Choices (aligned with `docs/scaling.md` Phase 4):

### 8.1 Database Migration to PostgreSQL
- **Action:** Use Prisma's migration capabilities to transition the database from SQLite to PostgreSQL.
- **Benefits:** PostgreSQL offers superior concurrency, scalability, robustness, and advanced features suitable for larger datasets and higher transaction volumes.
- **Impact:** Application code using Prisma Client will remain largely unchanged, demonstrating the power of the ORM.

### 8.2 Advanced Caching Layer
- **Technology:** Expand the use of Redis (introduced with job queues) or a similar caching solution.
- **Strategy:** Implement caching for frequently accessed, computationally expensive, or relatively static data:
    - Wallet summaries or frequently requested aggregated metrics from the API.
    - Results of common queries to `DatabaseService`.
- **Invalidation:** Develop a clear cache invalidation strategy to ensure data consistency.

### 8.3 Analytical Acceleration (If Required for Complex Dashboarding)
- **Context:** If dashboard queries remain slow even with PostgreSQL and caching, for highly complex, read-heavy analytics.
- **Options:**
    - **DuckDB:** For local or embedded analytics, potentially querying Parquet exports or a read replica of PostgreSQL.
    - **ETL + Data Warehouse (for very large scale):** Implement an ETL process to move data from PostgreSQL to a specialized analytical store (e.g., ClickHouse, BigQuery) if the application evolves into a large multi-user service requiring extensive BI capabilities. This is a significant architectural step and considered far-future.
