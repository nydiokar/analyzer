CURRENTLY SOME TOKENS ARE NOT HAVING ASSOCIATE SOL VALUE - WE NEED TO MAP THE EXACT VALUE OF THE OTHER TOKEN IF PRESENT .... DB SHOWS IT 

# The goal is to modify the mapHeliusTransactionsToIntermediateRecords function to achieve two main things within its existing single pass through the transaction data:

1. Populate interactionType: For every SwapAnalysisInput record created, determine and store a context label TYPE: (like 'SWAP', 'TOKEN_TRANSFER', 'LIMIT_ORDER_INIT', etc.) based on the Helius transaction details.

2. Enhance associatedSolValue Calculation: Use the existing WSOL-based logic as the primary method. However, if that logic results in an associatedSolValue of 0 when SWAP is done, then check the transaction's nativeBalanceChange for the wallet. If the native SOL change makes sense for the transfer direction (e.g., SOL decreased for an incoming token, SOL increased for an outgoing token), use the absolute value of that SOL change as the associatedSolValue.

This approach modifies the outcome for each processed transfer within the existing structure, ensuring:
All relevant transfers are still processed once.
Value assignment is improved by adding the nativeBalanceChange fallback.
Context is added via interactionType.
