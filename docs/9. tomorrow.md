Make sure we are doing the correct score for similarity and jacard, maybe conside removing the tokens without fees paid ?

Introduce job ID  through BULLMQ or something like that 


Breakdown of the Flaw
A. No Workers = No Asynchronous Enrichment
You need a queue-based worker system (e.g. BullMQ) to:

Resolve unknown mints

Fetch missing prices

Cache metadata

Without it, all enrichment happens during request/response cycle.

B. No Global Token State
Without a global token registry (DB table or Redis set), your system has no memory of which tokens:

Have known prices

Were recently seen

Are worth tracking (high market cap / frequent holders)

So each request starts from zero.

C. Cold Path = High Latency
New wallet -> new mints -> full enrichment -> multiple API calls → slow.

Correct Behavior with Workers and Price Registry
Request triggers job, not immediate price fetch.

Job enriches new tokens (price, metadata).

Stores results in DB or Redis.

UI polls or refreshes once data is available.

Frequent tokens have cached prices

Updated globally every X min

Shared across all users

Unknown tokens are background-resolved

Stored in a pending state

User sees placeholder or “resolving...” in frontend

Conclusion
Yes, you're right. Once you:

Add worker queue with retry/backoff

Track seen tokens globally

Cache prices and metadata out-of-band


1. Worker System: Use BullMQ
BullMQ (built on Redis) is optimal for a NestJS + Node environment:

Mature ecosystem

Built-in retries, backoff, rate limiting

Integrates well with async task pipelines

Can persist job metadata for audit/debugging

Install:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install bullmq ioredis
Setup:

Create token-enrichment.queue.ts with a BullMQ queue

Create a worker token-enrichment.worker.ts that resolves metadata and price

Use Redis for transport and job locking

Job lifecycle:

On wallet analysis: enqueue unknown mints

Worker picks them, enriches, stores result in DB/Redis

Frontend can poll for status if needed

2. Global Token State: Redis vs DB Table
Redis (Cache Layer):
Use Redis to:

Store price snapshots: token:price:<mint> = USD value

Store processing flags: token:status:<mint> = pending|resolved|failed

LRU or TTL-based eviction

Pros:

Fast

Ephemeral

Ideal for request-time access

DB Table (Persistent Registry):
Create a tokens table:

sql
Copy
Edit
USE TABLE TOKENINFO (
  mint TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  symbol TEXT,
  image_url TEXT,
  price_usd FLOAT,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP,
  is_active BOOLEAN
);

Use it for:

Permanent storage of known tokens

Batch refresh (e.g. every 10 min)

Long-tail token tracking

Pros:

Persistent

Indexed

Queryable for stats, audit, cleanup

Combined Approach (Best Practice)
Token enrichment worker:

Resolves unknown mints

Writes to tokens table

Caches latest price in Redis (token:price:<mint>)

Frontend/backend analysis:

Pulls price from Redis

Falls back to DB if needed

If unknown, enqueue job

Periodic cron job:

Refresh top tokens from Dexscreener (by volume/holders)

Update DB + Redis

Summary
Use BullMQ with Redis for job queue and processing

Use Redis for fast access, short TTL

Use SQL table for full token registry

Enqueue on miss, resolve in background, store persistently
