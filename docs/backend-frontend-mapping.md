# Backend-Frontend API Mapping & Scaling Analysis

## 🚨 **KEY INSIGHT: The System is NOT Built on Direct Job Endpoints**

**Current Reality**: The frontend uses **business logic endpoints** (`/analyses/*`) that internally manage BullMQ queues. The direct job submission endpoints (`/jobs/*`) exist but are **unused** - they're for future scaling scenarios.

## 🎯 **Current Active Endpoints (Actually Used)**

| Frontend Component | Backend Endpoint | Purpose | Queue Used | Why This Design? |
|-------------------|------------------|---------|------------|------------------|
| **WalletSearch** (Sidebar) | `POST /analyses/wallets/{id}/trigger-analysis` | Individual wallet sync + PnL + behavior analysis | `wallet-operations` + `analysis-operations` | **High-level convenience**: One click analyzes everything for a wallet |
| **SimilarityLab** (Main analysis) | `POST /analyses/similarity/queue` | Multi-wallet similarity analysis with smart sync | `similarity-operations` | **Intelligent orchestration**: Checks which wallets need sync, runs similarity |
| **SimilarityLab** (Price refresh) | `POST /analyses/similarity/enrich-balances` | Enrich token metadata for multiple wallets | `enrichment-operations` | **Multi-wallet optimization**: Batch enrichment is more efficient |
| **TokenPerformanceTab** (Dashboard) | `POST /wallets/{id}/enrich-all-tokens` | Enrich all tokens for one wallet | `enrichment-operations` | **Single wallet focus**: Dashboard only cares about one wallet |
| **useJobProgress Hook** | `GET /jobs/{jobId}` + WebSocket | Monitor job progress & get results | N/A | **Universal monitoring**: Works for any job type |

## 🚫 **Unused Job Submission Endpoints (Never Called)**

| Endpoint | Purpose | Queue Target | Why Unused? |
|----------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `POST /jobs/wallets/sync` | Direct wallet sync job submission | `wallet-operations` | **Too low-level**: Frontend wants sync+analysis, not just sync |
| `POST /jobs/wallets/analyze` | Direct wallet analysis job submission | `analysis-operations` | **Too granular**: Frontend wants complete workflow, not individual steps |
| `POST /jobs/similarity/analyze` | Direct similarity job submission | `similarity-operations` | **Missing intelligence**: No automatic sync detection |

## 🔄 **The Two Enrichment Patterns (Both Valid)**

### Pattern 1: Single Wallet Enrichment
```
TokenPerformanceTab → /wallets/{id}/enrich-all-tokens → enrichment-operations
```
- **Use Case**: Dashboard viewing one wallet
- **Optimization**: Enriches ALL tokens for that wallet
- **User Context**: "I'm looking at wallet X, make all its tokens pretty"

### Pattern 2: Multi-Wallet Enrichment  
```
SimilarityLab → /analyses/similarity/enrich-balances → enrichment-operations
```
- **Use Case**: Similarity analysis with multiple wallets
- **Optimization**: Only enriches tokens that appear in the analysis
- **User Context**: "I'm comparing wallets, make the shared tokens pretty"

## 🏗️ **Scaling Architecture Analysis**

### **Current Architecture: High-Level + Smart**
```
Frontend → Business Logic Endpoints → Internal Queue Management
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ **One-click workflows**: `/trigger-analysis` does sync+PnL+behavior automatically
- ✅ **Intelligent batching**: Similarity endpoint checks wallet status and syncs only what's needed
- ✅ **Error handling**: Business logic layer handles failures and retries
- ✅ **Optimized flows**: Each endpoint is optimized for its specific use case

### **Alternative Architecture: Low-Level + Manual**
```
Frontend → Direct Job Submission → Manual Queue Management
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Maximum control**: Frontend decides exactly which jobs to run
- ✅ **Granular scaling**: Can submit hundreds of individual jobs
- ✅ **Parallel workflows**: Could run sync and analysis in parallel manually

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Complex frontend**: Frontend must understand job dependencies
- ❌ **Error handling**: Frontend must handle partial failures
- ❌ **Inefficient**: No automatic optimization (e.g., skip sync if data is fresh)

## 🚀 **Scaling Scenarios & Recommendations**

### **Scenario 1: Processing 1000s of Wallets**
**Current Architecture:**
```typescript
// Frontend submits one high-level job
POST /analyses/similarity/queue
{
  walletAddresses: [1000 wallets],
  vectorType: 'capital'
}
// Backend intelligently:
// - Checks which wallets need sync (maybe only 100)
// - Syncs only those 100 in parallel
// - Runs similarity on all 1000
```

**Low-Level Architecture:**
```typescript
// Frontend must manage complexity
const walletsToSync = await checkWalletStatus(allWallets);
const syncJobs = await Promise.all(
  walletsToSync.map(w => POST `/jobs/wallets/sync`)
);
await waitForJobs(syncJobs);
const analysisJob = await POST `/jobs/similarity/analyze`;
```

### **Scenario 2: Bulk Wallet Onboarding**
**Current Architecture:**
```typescript
// Not optimal - designed for user workflows
wallets.forEach(wallet => 
  POST `/analyses/wallets/${wallet}/trigger-analysis`
);
```

**Low-Level Architecture:**
```typescript
// Better for bulk operations
const jobs = wallets.map(wallet => ({
  walletAddress: wallet,
  fetchAll: true
}));
await POST `/jobs/wallets/sync` (bulk endpoint)
```

### **Scenario 3: External System Integration**
**Current Architecture:**
- External systems must use high-level endpoints
- Limited control over job scheduling

**Low-Level Architecture:**
- External systems get full control
- Can implement custom batching logic

## 🎯 **Final Recommendation: Keep Both!**

### **Keep Current High-Level Endpoints For:**
- ✅ **User-facing features** (current frontend)
- ✅ **Optimized workflows** (smart sync detection)  
- ✅ **Simple integrations** (one endpoint does everything)

### **Keep Low-Level Job Endpoints For:**
- 🚀 **Bulk operations** (processing thousands of wallets)
- 🔧 **External integrations** (other services using your API)
- 📊 **Custom workflows** (research tools, automated systems)
- ⚡ **Performance optimization** (manual control over job scheduling)

### **Suggested Enhancement:**
Add bulk versions of the job submission endpoints:

```typescript
POST /jobs/wallets/sync-bulk
{
  wallets: [
    { walletAddress: "addr1", priority: "high" },
    { walletAddress: "addr2", priority: "low" }
  ],
  batchSize: 50
}
```

This gives you **both worlds**:
- High-level endpoints for current frontend
- Low-level endpoints for scaling scenarios
- Best of both architectures

## 📊 **Usage Metrics to Track**

Monitor these to decide future direction:
- Which endpoints get the most traffic?
- What's the average job size (1 wallet vs 100 wallets)?
- How often do external systems use the API?
- What percentage of similarity analyses involve syncing?

**Current State**: Your frontend uses high-level endpoints exclusively, but the low-level ones are your **scaling gateway** for future use cases! 🚀
