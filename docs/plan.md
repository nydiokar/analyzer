Goal of this functionality 

✅ You can extract token creations via Helius by filtering for Authority addresses (like Pump Swap and Raydium Launchpad),

✅ You don't need raw real-time data — you want trendlines, not second-by-second snipes,

✅ Your goal is to track shifts, behaviors, and long-term alpha from creation → migration → LP activity,

Let’s reshape this into a powerful, efficient plan that brings maximum value with minimum overhead.

⚙️ Phase 1: Data Pipeline MVP (2 days)
🛠️ Extract via Helius
Set up a lightweight service that:

Polls token creation data from:

🟢 Pump.fun Authority: TSLvdd1pWpHVjahSpsvCXUbgwsL3JAcvokwaKt1eokM

🔵 Raydium Launchpad Authority: WLHv2UAZm6z4KyaaELi5pjdbJh6RESMva1Rnn8pJVVh 

Using Helius APIs:

Fetch token mint logs by authority address.

Include metadata: mint address, timestamp, name, symbol, creator, etc.

Save to SQLite or DuckDB (start simple, scale later).

➡️ Output: Table with token info, source (Pump.fun or Raydium), and timestamp.

📊 Phase 2: Trend Analyzer Layer (1–2 days)
Build a small script that runs hourly or daily:

Groups new mints by day.

Tracks:

🪙 Token creation velocity (Pump.fun vs Raydium launchpad)

🔁 Migrations (how many tokens migrate to Pump swap and to Raydium)

📈 Wallet overlap or total active wallets (if creator/wallets included in mint logs)

➡️ Sample Output:

Edit
{
  "date": "2025-04-18",
  "pumpfun_tokens": 132,
  "raydium_tokens": 47,
  "migrated_tokens_pump": 19,
  "migrated_tokens_ray": 7
  "avg_time_to_migrate_pump": "3h42m",
  "avg_time_to_migrate_ray": "7h42m",
  "unique_wallets": 88
}
📺 Phase 3: Visual Intelligence Dashboard (2 days)
Add a /war route to your existing React frontend showing:

📆 Daily token creation chart (stacked Pump.fun vs Raydium)

🚚 Migration funnel (e.g. Sankey or bar chart)

🔄 Average time-to-migrate stat

🧠 Optional: wordcloud of token names (showing what’s hot/meme-y)

Optional Pro Feature:

Enable historical browsing with ?from=YYYY-MM-DD&to=YYYY-MM-DD.

💡 Value-Add Layer (Differentiator)
You want to go beyond just showing charts. So here’s how to add real value traders care about:

🧠 Smart Migration Signal (Alpha Points)
For each token:

Did it migrate within 24h?

Did it get LPed on Raydium?

Was it touched by a known active wallet (top wallet list you build)?

Give each token a “migration strength” score:

0–100 rating

Use it to filter top potential movers

🧼 Token Hygiene Filter
Flag tokens that:

Got created but had 0 volume

Were rugged (creator drained liquidity)

Or had 100% supply held by 1 wallet

This gives your viewer more signal, less spam.

💸 Monetization Option (Post-MVP)
Once dashboard is working:

Lock /war-analytics?depth=wallets and /export.csv behind a Stripe + USDC subscription.

Telegram bot: add /migration command → returns “today’s pumpfun → raydium tokens” with their momentum rating.

Offer 7-day free pass codes to influencers.
