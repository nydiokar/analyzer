But how is this gonna compare to good service ? I mean is this the best way to do it ? I currently might hhave had fault start with this and patching something that is not quite what we need it to be ? 

I was imagining so every user can have a wallet tracking list which is connected to webhook and it's always storing and doing analysis at certain times or when the wallet is called for the user. And this is the easiest way to control only wallets that are used by users to be up-to-date while all other wallets are only updated fully when called, is this reasonable ? What does this mean for our logic of how the analysis is done and what is the good way to deal with this ? This is the foundational logic of how the system should work and I want to get it right. We might separate the fetching from aggreation which is good but we still gonna struggle on when to fetch - the problem is not fetching + aggregation but when to happen and how to be efficient right

You're hitting the foundational tension: event-driven computation vs. schedule-based precomputation vs. lazy evaluation. Your design must balance freshness, cost-efficiency, and system control. Here's the reality:

You’re Not Far Off
You don’t need to start over. What you’ve built can evolve into a robust system with clean separation between:

Tracking orchestration (who, what, when)

Fetching engine (raw tx ingestion)

Aggregation engine (metrics computation)

API surface (dashboard delivery)

But your current issue is lack of authority logic around when anything happens. That’s solvable.

Define the Core Principles
Wallets are not equal. Only wallets users track need freshness guarantees.

Analysis should be demand-aware. Don’t aggregate unless someone’s watching.

Fetching is expensive. Aggregation is less expensive. Serve stale data if nobody cares.

Adopt a Tiered Strategy
1. User-Tracked Wallets = Active Tier
These are the wallets that:

Appear in user watchlists

Have active webhooks

Get hit in frontend regularly

Mechanism:

Maintain a TrackedWallets table per user

On wallet add → enqueue webhook listener / polling job

When new txs are detected → enqueue fetch → enqueue aggregate

This guarantees fresh + precomputed data for tracked wallets.

2. Untracked Wallets = Lazy Tier
These wallets:

Only analyzed when API is called manually

Don’t cost you resources unless accessed

Mechanism:

On API hit, check WalletSyncState

If outdated, fetch+aggregate on demand

If fresh, serve cached metrics

This ensures only necessary effort is spent.

Trigger Logic Summary
Event	Action
User adds wallet	Register in TrackedWallets + start polling job
New txs detected	Add to AnalysisQueue for fetch + aggregation
Dashboard loads wallet data	Check WalletSyncState → aggregate if stale
Scheduled background sweep	Optional daily batch for tier-2 wallets

System Component Map (Clean)
TrackedWallets: defines user-interest

WalletSyncState: defines freshness

SwapAnalysisInput: stores raw tx

AnalysisResult: stores per-token computed state

AnalysisQueue: drives computation (optional, good for scaling)

Verdict
This architecture:

Separates fetching from computation

Makes data freshness policy-driven

Supports both real-time and lazy paths

Enables scaling through background workers or jobs






PHASE 3 — API LOGIC (DATA SERVING)
5. Dashboard API Behavior

On wallet load request:

Check WalletSyncState

If outdated → trigger fetch → aggregate → return data

If fresh → serve cached AnalysisResult rows

6. Webhook/Watchlist Integration

When user adds wallet to watchlist:

Insert into TrackedWallets

Start polling or webhook monitor for this wallet

When new txs arrive via webhook:

Immediately trigger fetch and enqueue aggregation
