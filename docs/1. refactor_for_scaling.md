# Wallet Analysis System Refactoring Implementation Plan (Revised)

**Status Update (as of current conversation):** Core logic extraction is largely complete for Behavior, Correlation, Similarity, and PNL/Stats analysis. Reporting Service handles report generation. Scripts for `activityCorrelator`, `wallet-behavior-analyzer`, `kpi-comparison-report`, and `helius-analyzer` have been refactored to use the new services. 
## Phase 1: Core Analysis Logic Extraction (Complete for Behavior/Correlation/Similarity)

### 1.1 Reorganize Existing Types (Complete)
Location: `src/types/`
- Types are consolidated in `analysis.ts`, `behavior.ts`, `correlation.ts`, `similarity.ts`, `wallet.ts`, etc.

### 1.2 Extract Core Analysis Logic (Complete for Behavior/Correlation/Similarity)

#### 1.2.1 Correlation Analysis
Location: `src/wallet_analysis/core/correlation/analyzer.ts`
- `CorrelationAnalyzer` class encapsulates pairwise scoring, clustering, and global token stats calculation, migrated from `activityCorrelator.ts`.

#### 1.2.2 Behavior Analysis
Location: `src/wallet_analysis/core/behavior/analyzer.ts`
- `BehaviorAnalyzer` class encapsulates sequence building, metrics calculation, and classification, migrated from `wallet-behavior-analyzer.ts`.

#### 1.2.3 Similarity Analysis
Location: `src/wallet_analysis/core/similarity/analyzer.ts`
- `SimilarityAnalyzer` class encapsulates vector creation (capital/binary) and similarity scoring (cosine), migrated from `walletSimilarity.ts`.

#### 1.2.4 KPI Reporting Analysis
Location: `src/wallet_analysis/core/reporting/kpi_analyzer.ts`
- `KPIComparisonAnalyzer` encapsulates comparative report generation logic from `kpi-comparison-report.ts`.

### 1.3 Extract Utility Functions (Complete)

#### 1.3.1 PNL Calculation
Location: `src/wallet_analysis/utils/pnl_calculator.ts`
- Contains `calculateWalletPnl` and `calculatePnlForWallets`, extracted from `activityCorrelator.ts`.

#### 1.3.2 Reporting Utilities
Location: `src/wallet_analysis/reporting/report_utils.ts`
- Contains `generateBehaviorReport`, `generateCorrelationReport`, `generateSimilarityReport`, and `saveReport`, consolidating logic from multiple scripts.

## Phase 2: Service Layer Enhancement (Complete for Behavior/Correlation/Similarity/Reporting)

### 2.1 Analysis Services
Location: `src/wallet_analysis/services/`

#### 2.1.1 `CorrelationService`
- Uses `CorrelationAnalyzer`.
- Integrates database fetching (via `DatabaseService`).
- Integrates bot filtering logic (from `activityCorrelator.ts`).
- Integrates PNL calculation (using `pnl_calculator.ts`).

#### 2.1.2 `BehaviorService`
- Uses `BehaviorAnalyzer`.
- Integrates database fetching (via `DatabaseService`).

#### 2.1.3 `SimilarityService`
- Uses `SimilarityAnalyzer`.
- Integrates database fetching (via `DatabaseService`).
- Integrates shared token analysis (from `walletSimilarity.ts`).

#### 2.1.4 `ReportingService`
- Uses `BehaviorService`, `CorrelationService` (optional), `SimilarityService` (optional), `KPIComparisonAnalyzer`.
- Uses `report_utils.ts` to generate and save various report types (individual behavior, comparative behavior, correlation, similarity).

### 2.2 Enhance Existing Services (Ongoing)

- `DatabaseService`: Refactored into a class. Imports in older scripts like `helius-analyzer.ts` need updating.
- `HeliusApiClient`: Assumed functional based on plan.
- `HeliusTransactionMapper`: Assumed functional based on plan.

## Phase 3: Script Refactoring (Ongoing)

**Goal:** Transform scripts in `src/scripts/` to act as simple orchestrators or entry points that primarily call the new services.

### 3.1 `activityCorrelator.ts`
- **Status: Complete**
- The script now handles CLI argument parsing (wallet source, excludeMints, timeRange).
- It instantiates `DatabaseService`, `CorrelationService`, and `ReportingService`.
- It creates `CorrelationAnalysisConfig` with CLI args.
- It calls `reportingService.generateAndSaveCorrelationReport` to orchestrate the analysis and reporting.
- Internal logic for fetching, filtering, PNL calculation, analysis, clustering, and report generation has been removed.

### 3.2 `wallet-behavior-analyzer.ts`
- **Status: Complete** 
- The script now handles CLI argument parsing (walletAddress, label, excludeMints, timeRange).
- It instantiates `DatabaseService`, `BehaviorService`, and `ReportingService`.
- It creates `BehaviorAnalysisConfig` with CLI args.
- It calls `behaviorService.analyzeWalletBehavior`.
- It calls `reportingService.generateAndSaveIndividualBehaviorReport`.
- Internal logic for fetching, analysis, and reporting has been removed.

### 3.3 `kpi-comparison-report.ts`
- **Status: Complete** 
- The script now handles CLI argument parsing (walletList file, excludeMints, timeRange).
- It instantiates `DatabaseService`, `BehaviorService`, `KPIComparisonAnalyzer`, and `ReportingService`.
- It creates `BehaviorAnalysisConfig` with CLI args.
- It calls `reportingService.generateComparativeBehaviorReport`.
- Internal logic for fetching, analysis, and reporting has been removed.

### 3.4 `walletSimilarity.ts`
- **Status: To Do**
- **Goal:** Update `main` function to orchestrate service calls.
- **Required Refactoring Steps:**
    - Parse CLI args (wallet source, vector type, potentially timeRange/excludeMints).
    - Instantiate `DatabaseService` and `SimilarityService`.
    - Create `SimilarityAnalysisConfig` (potentially including timeRange/excludeMints).
    - Instantiate `ReportingService` (injecting `SimilarityService`).
    - Call `reportingService.generateAndSaveSimilarityReport(walletAddresses, vectorType)`.
    - Remove internal logic for fetching, shared token analysis, vector creation, similarity calc, and reporting.

### 3.5 `helius-analyzer.ts`
- **Status: Complete**
- **Description:** The script has been refactored to act as an orchestrator, leveraging dedicated services (`HeliusSyncService`, `PnlAnalysisService`, `ReportingService`, `DatabaseService`) for data synchronization, analysis, and reporting, preserving previous functionalities like fetching modes and CSV export.
- **Key Components Used:**
    - `HeliusSyncService`: Manages data fetching, mapping, and storage.
    - `PnlAnalysisService`: Orchestrates P/L and stats calculation.
    - `ReportingService`: Generates and saves Markdown/CSV reports.
    - `DatabaseService`: Used directly by the script for managing `AnalysisRun` records.
    - `cliUtils` / `displayUtils`: For parsing and displaying.
- **Refactoring Steps Taken (Summary):**
    1. Extracted core swap logic to `SwapAnalyzer`.
    2. Extracted core stats logic to `AdvancedStatsAnalyzer`.
    3. Created `HeliusSyncService` for data fetching/syncing.
    4. Created `PnlAnalysisService` for orchestrating analysis.
    5. Updated `ReportingService` and `report_utils.ts` for PNL reports.
    6. Refactored `helius-analyzer.ts` script to use these services and manage `AnalysisRun` persistence.

## Phase 4: API Layer Preparation (Future)

- Remains unchanged from the original plan. API interfaces can be built on top of the service layer.
