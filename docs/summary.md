üìã COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY: All Changes Made During This Session
You're absolutely right - this became a chaotic debugging session! Here's EVERYTHING we changed, organized by impact:
üéØ SUCCESSFUL IMPROVEMENTS (Keep These)
1. Database Performance Optimizations ‚úÖ
Files Changed:
src/core/services/database-service.ts
src/api/pnl_analysis/pnl-analysis.service.ts
What We Fixed:
Batch upserts instead of individual database operations
Added batchUpsertAnalysisResults method (50 records per batch)
SQLite optimizations: WAL mode, memory temp store, 10MB cache
Fixed Prisma transaction timeout errors
Performance Gain: 10-second delays ‚Üí milliseconds
2. System Wallet Protection ‚úÖ
Files Changed:
src/config/constants.ts
src/core/services/database-service.ts
src/queues/processors/similarity-operations.processor.ts
What We Added:
KNOWN_SYSTEM_WALLETS list (Jupiter, system accounts with 270k+ tokens)
WALLET_CLASSIFICATIONS enum (NORMAL, SYSTEM, JUPITER, EXCHANGE, BOT, INVALID, LARGE)
Pre-filtering logic to tag and skip INVALID wallets before processing
UPSERT instead of UPDATE in updateWalletClassification (critical fix!)
Performance Gain: Prevents system crashes from massive token wallets
3. True Parallelism Architecture ‚úÖ
Files Changed:
src/queues/processors/similarity-operations.processor.ts
What We Fixed:
Apply to package.json
Performance Gain: Balance fetching no longer blocks transaction sync
üö® PROBLEMATIC CHANGES (Need Review/Revert)
4. Enrichment "Optimizations" That Broke UX ‚ùå
Files Changed:
src/queues/processors/enrichment-operations.processor.ts
src/queues/config/queue.config.ts
src/core/analysis/similarity/similarity-service.ts
What We Changed:
Added complex token filtering logic to reduce 32k+ tokens to ~9k
Added filterToActivelyTradedTokens method with USD value filtering
Increased timeouts from 30min ‚Üí 45min
REMOVED progress updates from enrichment jobs (this broke frontend UX!)
Changed from individual DB queries to batch queries in similarity service
Problems Created:
Progress stuck at 60% - frontend no longer gets completion signals
WebSocket job mismatches - using wrong IDs for frontend subscriptions
BullMQ lock renewal errors - jobs timing out despite optimizations
5. Logging Changes ‚úÖ/‚ùå
Files Changed:
src/core/services/dexscreener-service.ts
What We Changed:
Progress logging: every 10 chunks ‚Üí every 20 chunks
Progress summaries: every 5 batches ‚Üí every 10 batches
Batch logging: every batch ‚Üí every 5 batches
Mixed Results: Reduced noise but may have hidden important debugging info
üîß LATEST CRITICAL FIXES (Just Applied)
6. WebSocket & Progress Fix Attempts ‚ö†Ô∏è
Files Changed:
src/queues/processors/similarity-operations.processor.ts
src/queues/processors/enrichment-operations.processor.ts
What We Just Changed:
Made enrichment "fire-and-forget" with error handling
REMOVED all progress updates from enrichment jobs
Changed WebSocket events to use requestId instead of job.id
Added BullMQ worker options: maxStalledCount: 3, stalledInterval: 30s
Status: üîÑ UNTESTED - need to verify these actually fix the UX issues
üìä PERFORMANCE IMPACT SUMMARY
Before Our Changes:
Database operations: 10+ second delays
System crashes: 270k+ token wallets crashed the system
Sequential processing: Balance fetch blocked everything
Cache staleness: 24-hour cache showed outdated data
After Our Changes:
Database operations: ‚úÖ Millisecond responses via batching
System stability: ‚úÖ Large wallets filtered out safely
True parallelism: ‚úÖ Sync + balance fetch run simultaneously
Cache freshness: ‚úÖ 5-minute cache for real-time data
New Problems We Created:
Frontend UX: ‚ùå Progress stuck at 60%, no completion signals
Job management: ‚ùå BullMQ lock renewal failures
WebSocket conflicts: ‚ùå Frontend subscribes to wrong job IDs
Complexity: ‚ùå Added sophisticated filtering that may be overkill
üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT SESSION
Keep These Changes:
‚úÖ Database batch upserts (massive performance win)
‚úÖ System wallet filtering (prevents crashes)
‚úÖ True parallelism (architectural improvement)
‚úÖ UPSERT fix (prevents database errors)
Investigate/Revert These:
‚ùå Enrichment progress removal (broke frontend UX)
‚ùå Complex token filtering (may be unnecessary)
‚ùå WebSocket job ID changes (need to verify frontend compatibility)
‚ùå Increased timeouts (may mask underlying issues)
Priority Actions:
TEST the latest WebSocket fixes to see if progress works
REVERT enrichment progress updates if frontend still broken
SIMPLIFY the token filtering logic - the 72% reduction might be overkill
VERIFY that similarity results are actually returned immediately (not waiting for enrichment)

The session started with legitimate performance issues and we fixed them, but then we over-optimized and broke the user experience. The core architectural improvements are solid, but the latest "optimizations" need careful review! üéØ
