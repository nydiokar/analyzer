Based on the enhanced raw input, the current format already captures critical indicators of shared strategy: capital similarity, token overlap, directionality of investment concentration, and contextual tags (e.g., FIP, SC, VHS). However, for higher-value LLM digestion and deeper entity modeling, restructure and extend it as follows:

1. Transform Into a Graph Schema (Entity-Centric View)
Structure:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "wallets": {
    "5LEhdhS7": {
      "neighbors": [
        {
          "wallet": "GyqKuTj3",
          "similarity": 0.998,
          "overlap_ratio": 0.692,
          "common_tokens": 18,
          "tags": ["SC", "FIP"]
        },
        ...
      ],
      "avg_similarity": 0.943,
      "dominant_tokens": ["TokenA", "TokenB"],
      "behavior": "Focused Concordant Holder"
    },
    ...
  }
}
Purpose: LLM can reason over this structure to:

Find communities (clusters)

Trace strong vs weak ties

Identify bridging wallets (multi-cluster connections)

2. Flatten Each Wallet’s Strategic Profile
Augment each wallet with a high-level strategic summary:

Wallet	Role	Avg Sim	Overlap	Shared Tokens	Dominant Token	Pattern
5LEhdhS7	Anchor Node	0.943	0.65	18	TokenA	Stable Concordance
7fD7SNR5	Mirror Node	0.997	1.0	2	WSOL	Single-Token Bot
8UakNrK5	Strategy Core	0.99	0.66	21	TokenX	Multi-Wallet Control

Purpose: LLM can now attribute identity-like roles to wallets and predict behavioral origin (bot, coordinated human, influencer-led group, etc).

3. Merge Pairs into Cluster Blocks Before Prompting
Group into pre-labeled clusters, then feed to LLM:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "clusters": [
    {
      "name": "Legacy Anchor Cluster",
      "wallets": ["5LEhdhS7", "GyqKuTj3", "8hmnnPxm", "9tJyK53Z"],
      "shared_tokens": 18,
      "avg_similarity": 0.94,
      "dominant_behavior": "Passive Alignment",
      "notes": "High FIP, little divergence, likely coordinated or copied."
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Purpose: Speeds up LLM deduction — no need to reconstruct cluster logic from raw pairs.

4. Include Token-Level Semantics
For each shared token:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "token": "TokenX",
  "type": "Meme",
  "volatility": "High",
  "trend": "Declining",
  "appears_in": ["8UakNrK5", "CpmPzxUC", "C4mVV5oR"]
}
Purpose: LLM can now analyze narrative-driven behavior, not just structural similarity.

5. Time-Differential Footprint (Optional)
If possible, include when overlap occurred:

json
Copy
Edit
"first_common_tx": "2024-12-01",
"last_common_tx": "2025-01-20"
Helps LLM assess whether clustering is sustained, decayed, or recently formed.

Final Complementary Additions
Degree centrality scores

Bridge scores (wallets that connect multiple dense subgraphs)

Strategic entropy (low = focused wallet)

Result
With this restructuring:

Each wallet becomes an analyzable “agent”

LLM can infer control dynamics, coordination strategies, and intent

Enables projection of unseen wallet behavior or future moves

Convert current format → entity-oriented graph + cluster profiles → feed to LLM with behavior reconstruction task.


Initial prompt for LLM: 

You are a forensic analyst specialized in blockchain behavior analysis. You will be given a full Wallet Similarity Analysis Report (Type: capital). Your task is to extract value from this data by identifying meaningful clusters of wallets based on shared investment behavior, divergence signals, and strategic patterns. You must reason about the structure, highlight key alliances or divergences, and identify possible bot activity, mirrors, or human coordination.

Instructions:
Cluster Identification:
Group wallets into clusters based on:

High capital similarity (cosine > 0.9)

Shared token count with high % overlap on both sides (e.g., >50%)

FIP tags (Focused Investment Pattern) or SC (Strong Concordance) indicators
Label and name each cluster meaningfully.

Strategic Summary for Each Cluster:
For each identified cluster:

Describe the strategy type (e.g., high-risk mirroring, passive holding, narrow-focused execution).

Note shared token patterns and capital allocation behavior.

Highlight signs of coordination, divergence, or symmetry.

Outliers and Bridges:

Identify wallets that are peripheral or act as bridges across clusters.

Assess whether they are transitioning, isolated, or decaying.

Bot/Mimic Detection:

Flag pairs or clusters with near-identical allocation suggesting bot execution.

Use “Very High Similarity” and 100% token match with WSOL concentration as signals.

Summary Output:

Final report must include cluster list, key actors, observed behaviors, and any notable anomalies.

Output should help an analyst make decisions on which wallets are likely to be controlled by same entity or strategy.

Respond with an objective, well-reasoned analysis based solely on the provided data. Do not speculate beyond the report.
