Phase 1: Solid Foundation (Current Goal - Robust Local Analysis)

Core Task: Reliable analysis of individual (or a list of) wallets, handling large histories, enabling on-demand analysis of cached data.

Smart Choices:
ORM (Prisma): As discussed, use Prisma for type safety, migrations, and developer experience. Start with SQLite as the provider for simplicity and file-based portability. This is smart because it provides structure and ease-of-migration later.

Schema Design: Define a clear schema (schema.prisma) separating raw cache, intermediate records, analysis runs, results, and stats. Design foreign keys and indices properly from the start.
    - **Foresight (Data Granularity):** Ensure schema design anticipates data fields required for future API/dashboard views. Map dashboard mock-up fields to specific model attributes early. Address data gaps by refining core analyzers/services, not just the API layer.
    - **Foresight (Database Performance):** Implement comprehensive indexing from the start based on anticipated query patterns for both analysis and future API access.

Modular Code: Continue separating concerns (API client, mapping, analysis, stats, database service). Ensure modules interact through well-defined interfaces.

Decouple Fetching & Analysis: Refactor the main script/services so that the analysis logic (analyzeSwapRecords, calculateAdvancedStats) can be run independently by querying data from the database based on wallet address/time range, not just on freshly fetched data. This is key for on-demand analysis.

Introduce user table or access layer.

Phase 2: Performance & Asynchronous Operations (Scaling Bottlenecks)
Trigger: Analyzing very large wallets takes too long synchronously, or you want to process multiple wallets in parallel without blocking, or API calls for initiating analysis need to be non-blocking.
Smart Choices:

Job Queue System (e.g., BullMQ + Redis): Introduce Redis and a job queue library.
    - **Mitigation (Scalability of Services):** Job queues help manage concurrent execution of services. Ensure services are designed as stateless as possible.

Refactor: The main script (helius-analyzer.ts or a new entry point) now becomes a "job dispatcher". It takes a wallet address (or list), adds a "fetch-and-analyze" job to the queue, and potentially exits or waits/polls for completion. Any API endpoints triggering long analyses would also dispatch jobs.

Worker Service: Create separate Node.js worker process(es) that listen to the queue. Workers pick up jobs, execute the fetching (using HeliusApiClient), mapping, analysis (querying/using data potentially already in the DB via DatabaseService), and save results back to the DB via DatabaseService.
    - **Mitigation (Data Synchronization):** Workers ensure that analysis results are fresh. The system needs clear indicators of data "as-of" timestamps.

Benefits: Makes the initial trigger non-blocking. Allows scaling workers independently to process jobs faster (if API limits/CPU allow). Decouples the long-running task. Redis also provides opportunities for other caching.

Phase 3: User Interface & API Layer (Exposure & Usability)
Trigger: You need a web dashboard, want to expose the analysis via an API, or build a desktop app.

Smart Choices:
Backend API Framework (e.g., NestJS, Fastify, Express): Build a dedicated API server. NestJS integrates well with Prisma and encourages modularity.
    - **Consideration (Tech Stack & Learning Curve):** Account for team familiarity. Prototype key functionalities early to solidify project structure and best practices.
    - **Consideration (API Documentation):** Implement OpenAPI/Swagger documentation from day one.
    - **Consideration (Configuration Management):** Use environment variables for API configuration and secure API key handling.

Endpoints: Define API routes like /analyze/{walletAddress}, /analysis/{runId}, /wallet/{walletAddress}/summary, /wallet/{walletAddress}/history?token=...&start=...&end=....
    - **Mitigation (API Performance):** Design endpoints for efficient data retrieval. Rely on pre-computed results and proper database indexing. Implement pagination for list-based endpoints.
    - **Mitigation (Data Availability):** Ensure API endpoints can serve all data required by the dashboard. Detailed mapping from UI to data sources is crucial. Address gaps in underlying services/analyzers.

Interaction: The API interacts with the DatabaseService to retrieve data and with the Job Queue (from Phase 2) to trigger new analyses.
    - **Mitigation (User Auth Complexity):** Start with simple API key authentication. Design middleware with future RBAC extension in mind.
    - **Mitigation (Error Handling & Logging):** Implement standardized error responses and structured, correlated logging across API and services.

Frontend Framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte, Next.js, Nuxt): Build the dashboard UI, fetching data from your new backend API. Use charting libraries (Chart.js, Recharts) for visualization.

Real-time Updates (Optional): Use WebSockets (integrated via NestJS Gateways or libraries like ws, socket.io) to push analysis progress/completion notifications from the workers/job queue back to the frontend via the API server.

Phase 4: Advanced Scalability & Data Handling (Future-Proofing)
Trigger: SQLite performance degrades with massive multi-wallet data, write contention becomes an issue (unlikely for a local tool but possible if it becomes a service), or analytical queries become too slow.
Smart Choices:

Database Migration (PostgreSQL): Use Prisma's migration tools to switch the underlying database from SQLite to PostgreSQL. The application code using Prisma Client remains largely unchanged. This provides superior concurrency, scalability, and robustness.

Analytical Acceleration (DuckDB/ClickHouse/Warehouse): If read-heavy analytical queries for the dashboard are the bottleneck despite Postgres, consider:
DuckDB: For local acceleration, use DuckDB to directly query Parquet exports or even the live Postgres DB (via extensions) for complex reporting without impacting the main DB performance.
ETL + Warehouse: For a true service, implement an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process (maybe using background jobs) to move data from the transactional Postgres DB into an optimized analytical store (ClickHouse, BigQuery, Snowflake) specifically for dashboarding/BI.

Caching Layer (Redis): Implement more aggressive caching in Redis for frequently accessed data (wallet summaries, pre-computed dashboard metrics) to reduce database load.

Summary of the "Smart Way":
Start with Prisma + SQLite: Get the core right with type safety, migrations, and basic DB benefits. 
Decouple analysis from fetching.

Introduce Job Queues + Workers: Address performance bottlenecks for long tasks and enable parallel processing.

Build an API + Frontend: Create user-facing interfaces when needed, leveraging the decoupled backend.
Scale the Database (if needed): Migrate to Postgres using Prisma when SQLite limits are reached.

Optimize Analytics (if needed): Use specialized tools like DuckDB or data warehouses for heavy reporting.

This phased approach builds complexity based on need, uses modern, maintainable tools, and provides clear migration paths (SQLite -> Postgres, Files -> DB, Sync -> Async).
